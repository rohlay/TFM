### Foreword

by Paul Demieville
_Member of the Institut de France,_
_Professor at the College de France_
_Director of Buddhist Studies at the School_
_of Higher Studies (Paris)_



Here is an exposition of Buddhism conceived in a resolutely
modem spirit by one of the most qualified and enlightened
representatives of that religion. The Rev. Dr. W. Rahula received
the traditional training and education of a Buddhist monk in
Ceylon, and held eminent positions in one of the leading monastic
institutes (Pirivena) in that island, where the Law of the Buddha
flourishes from the time of Asoka and has preserved all its vitality
up to this day. Thus brought up in an ancient tradition, he decided,
at this time when all traditions are called in question, to face the
spirit and the methods of international scientific learning. He
entered the Ceylon University, obtained the B.A. Honours degree
(London), and then won the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the
Ceylon University on a highly learned thesis on the History of
Buddhism in Ceylon. Having worked with distinguished professors at the University of Calcutta and come in contact with adepts
of Mahayana (the Great Vehicle), that form of Buddhism which
reigns from Tibet to the Far East, he decided to go into the
Tibetan and Chinese texts in order to widen his cecumenism,
and he has honoured us by coming to the University of Paris
(Sorbonne) to prepare a study of Asanga, the illustrious philosopher of Mahayana, whose principal works in the original
Sanskrit are lost, and can only be read in their Tibetan and Chinese
translations. It is now eight years since Dr. Rahula is among us,
wearing the yellow robe, breathing the air of the Occident,
searching perhaps in our old troubled mirror a universalized
reflection of the religion which is his.

The book, which he has kindly asked me to present to the
public of the West, is a luminous account, within reach of everybody, of the fundamental principles of the Buddhist doctrine, as


they are found in the most ancient texts, which are called 'The
Tradition' ( _Agama_ ) in Sanskrit and 'The Canonic Corpus'
_(Nikaja_ ) in Pali. Dr. Rahula, who possesses an incomparable
knowledge of these texts, refers to them constantly and almost
exclusively. Their authority is recognized unanimously by all the
Buddhist schools, which were and are numerous, but none of
which ever deviates from these texts, except with the intention of
better interpreting the spirit beyond the letter. The interpretation
has indeed been varied in the course of the expansion of Buddhism
through many centuries and vast regions, and the Law has taken
more than one aspect. But the aspect of Buddhism here presented
by Dr. Rahula—humanist, rational, Socratic in some respects,
Evangelic in others, or again almost scientific—has for its support
a great deal of authentic scriptural evidence which he only had to
let speak for themselves.

The explanations which he adds to his quotations, always
translated with scrupulous accuracy, are clear, simple, direct, and
free from all pedantry. Some among them might lead to discussion,
as when he wishes to rediscover in the Pali sources all the
doctrines of Mahayana; but his familiarity with those sources
permits him to throw new light on them. He addresses himself to
the modern man, but he refrains from insisting on comparisons
just suggested here and there, which could be made with certain
currents of thought of the contemporary world: socialism,
atheism, existentialism, psycho-analysis. It is for the reader to
appreciate the modernity, the possibilities of adaptation of a
doctrine which, in this work of genuine scholarship, is presented
to him in its primal richness.


### Preface

All over the world today there is growing interest in Buddhism.
Numerous societies and study-groups have come into being, and
scores of books have appeared on the teaching of the Buddha. It
is to be regretted, however, that most of them have been written
by those who are not really competent, or who bring to their task
misleading assumptions derived from other religions, which must
misinterpret and misrepresent their subject. A professor of comparative religion who recently wrote a book on Buddhism did
not even know that Ananda, the devoted attendant of the Buddha,
was a _bhikk.hu_ (a monk), but thought he was a layman! The
knowledge of Buddhism propagated by books like these can be
left to the reader's imagination.

I have tried in this little book to address myself first of all to the
educated and intelligent general reader, uninstructed in the
subject, who would like to know what the Buddha actually
taught. For his benefit I have aimed at giving briefly, and as
directly and simply as possible, a faithful and accurate account of
the actual words used by the Buddha as they are to be found in
the original Pah texts of the _Tipitaka,_ universally accepted by
scholars as the earliest extant records of the teachings of the
Buddha. The material used and the passages quoted here are taken
directly from these originals. In a few places I have referred to
some later works too.

I have borne in mind, too, the reader who has already some
knowledge of what the Buddha taught and would like to go
further with his studies. I have therefore provided not only the
Pali equivalents of most of the key-words, but also references to
the original texts in footnotes, and a select bibliography.

The difficulties of my task have been manifold: throughout I
have tried to steer a course between the unfamiliar and the
popular, to give the English reader of the present day something
which he could understand and appreciate, without sacrificing
anything of the matter and the form of the discourses of the


viii


Buddha. Writing the book I have had the ancient texts running
in my mind, so I have deliberately kept the synonyms and repetitions which were a part of the Buddha's speech as it has come
down to us through oral tradition, in order that the reader should
have some notion of the form used by the Teacher. I have kept as
close as I could to the originals, and have tried to make my
translations easy and readable.

But there is a point beyond which it is difficult to take an idea
without losing in the interests of simplicity the particular meaning
the Buddha was interested in developing. As the title 'What the
Buddha Taught' was selected for this book, I felt that it would be
wrong not to set down the words of the Buddha, even the figures
he used, in preference to a rendering which might provide the
easy gratification of comprehensibility at the risk of distortion
of meaning.

I have discussed in this book almost everything which is
commonly accepted as the essential and fundamental teaching of
the Buddha. These are the doctrines of the Four Noble Truths,
the Noble Eightfold Path, the Five Aggregates, Karma, Rebirth,
Conditioned Genesis _(Paticcasamuppada)_, the doctrine of No-Soul
_{Anatta), Satipatthana_ (the Setting-up of Mindfulness). Naturally
there will be in the discussion expressions which must be unfamiliar
to the Western reader. I would ask him, if he is interested, to take
up on his first reading the opening chapter, and then go on to
Chapters V, VII and VIII, returning to Chapters II, III, IV and
VI when the general sense is clearer and more vivid. It would
not be possible to write a book on the teaching of the Buddha
without dealing with the subjects which _Theravada_ and _Mahayana_
Buddhism have accepted as fundamental in his system of thought.

The term _Theravada—Hinayana_ or 'Small Vehicle' is no longer
used in informed circles—could be translated as 'the School of the
Elders' ( _theras_ ), and _Mahayana_ as 'Great Vehicle'. They are used of
the two main forms of Buddhism known in the world today.
_Theravada,_ which is regarded as the original orthodox Buddhism,
is followed in Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and
Chittagong in East Pakistan. _Mahayana_, which developed relatively
later, is followed in other Buddhist countries like China, Japan,
Tibet, Mongolia, etc. There are certain differences, mainly with
regard to some beliefs, practices and observances between these


viii


two schools, but on the most important teachings of the Buddha,
such as those discussed here, _Theravada_ and _Mahayana_ are unanimously agreed.

It only remains for me now to express my sense of gratitude to
Professor E. F. C. Ludowyk, who in fact invited me to write this
book, for all the help given me, the interest taken in it, the suggestions he offered, and for reading through the manuscript. To
Miss Marianne Mohn too, who went through the manuscript and
made valuable suggestions, I am deeply grateful. Finally I am
greatly beholden to Professor Paul Demieville, my teacher in
Paris, for his kindness in writing the Foreword.

### The Buddha

**The Buddha, whose personal name was Siddhattha (Siddhartha in**
**Sanskrit), and family name Gotama (Skt. Gautama), lived in**
**North India in the 6th century B.C. His father, Suddhodana, was**
**the ruler of the kingdom of the Sakyas (in modern Nepal). His**
**mother was queen Maya. According to the custom of the time,**
**he was married quite young, at the age of sixteen, to a beautiful**
**and devoted young princess named Yasodhara. The young prince**
**lived in his palace with every luxury at his command. But all of a**
**sudden, confronted with the reality of life and the suffering of**
**mankind, he decided to find the solution—the way out of this**
**universal suffering. At the age of 29, soon after the birth of his**
**only child, Rahula, he left his kingdom and became an ascetic**
**in search of this solution.**

**For six years the ascetic Gotama wandered about the valley of**
**the Ganges, meeting famous religious teachers, studying and**
**following their systems and methods, and submitting himself to**
**rigorous ascetic practices.** **They** **did not** **satisfy him.** **So he**
**abandoned all traditional religions and their methods and went**
**his own way. It was thus that one evening, seated under a tree**
**(since then known as the Bodhi- or Bo-tree, 'the Tree of Wisdom'),**
**on the bank of the river Neranjara at Buddha-Gaya (near Gaya**
**in modern Bihar), at the age of 35, Gotama attained Enlightenment,**
**after which he was known as the Buddha, 'The Enlightened One'.**

**After his Enlightenment, Gotama the Buddha delivered his**
**first sermon to a group of five ascetics, his old colleagues, in the**
**Deer Park at Isipatana (modern Sarnath) near Benares. From that**
**day, for 45 years, he taught all classes of men and women—kings**
**and peasants, Brahmins and outcasts, bankers and beggars, holy**
**men** **and** **robbers—without** **making the** **slightest** **distinction**
**between them. He recognized no differences of caste or social**
**groupings, and the Way he preached was open to all men and**
**women w h o were ready to understand and to follow it.**

**At the age of 80, the Buddha passed away at Kusinara (in**
**modern Uttar Pradesh in India).**

**Today** **Buddhism** **is** **found** **in** **Ceylon,** **Burma,** **Thailand,**
**Cambodia,** **Laos,** **Vietnam,** **Tibet,** **China,** **Japan,** **Mongolia,**
**Korea, Formosa, in some parts of India, Pakistan and Nepal, and**
**also in the Soviet Union. The Buddhist population of the world**
**is over 500 million.**

CHAPTER I


**T H E** **B U D D H I S T** **A T T I T U D E** **O F** **M I N D**


**Among the founders of religions the Buddha (if we are permitted**
**to call him the founder of a religion in the popular sense of the**
**term) was the only teacher who did not claim to be other than a**
**human being, pure and simple. Other teachers were either God,**
**or his incarnations in different forms, or inspired by him. The**
**Buddha was not only a human being; he claimed no inspiration**
**from any god or external power either. He attributed all his**
**realization, attainments and achievements to human endeavour**
**and human intelligence. A man and only a man can become a**
**Buddha. Every man has within himself the potentiality of becom-**
**ing a Buddha, if he so wills it and endeavours. We can call the**
**Buddha a man** **He was so perfect in his 'human-ness'**
_par excellence._
**that he came to be regarded later in popular religion almost as**
**'super-human'.**

**Man's position, according to Buddhism, is supreme. Man is his**
**own master, and there is no higher being or power that sits in**
**judgment over his destiny.**

**'One is one's own refuge, who else could be the refuge ?'** **[1]** **said**
**the Buddha. He admonished his disciples to 'be a refuge to them-**
**selves', and never to seek refuge in or help from anybody else.** **[2 ]**

**He taught, encouraged and stimulated each person to develop**
**himself and to work out his own emancipation, for man has the**
**power to liberate himself from all bondage through his own**
**personal effort and intelligence. The Buddha says: ' Y o u should do**
**your work, for the Tathagatas** **[3]** **only teach the way.'** **[4]** **If the Buddha**
**is to be called a 'saviour' at all, it is only in the sense that he**

**D II (Colombo, 1929), p. 62 (** _Mabaparinibbana-sutta)._



_3_
_Tathagata_ **lit. means 'One who has come to Truth', i.e., 'One who has discovered**
**Truth'. This is the term usually used by the Buddha referring to himself and to the**
**Buddhas in general.**

**discovered and showed the Path to Liberation, Nirvana. But we**
**must tread the Path ourselves.**

**It is on this principle of individual responsibility that the**
**Buddha allows freedom to his disciples. In the**
_Mahaparinibbana-_
**the Buddha says that he never thought of controlling the**
_sutta_
**(Order of Monks)** **[1]** **, nor did he want the** **to depend**
_Sangha_ _Sangha_
**on him. He said that there was no esoteric doctrine in his teaching,**
**nothing hidden in the 'closed-fist of the teacher'** _(acarija-mutthi)_ **, or**
**to put it in other words, there never was anything 'up his sleeve'.** **[2 ]**

**The freedom of thought allowed by the Buddha is unheard of**
**elsewhere in the history of religions. This freedom is necessary**
**because, according to the Buddha, man's emancipation depends**
**on his own realization of Truth, and not on the benevolent grace of**
**a god or any external power as a reward for his obedient good**
**behaviour.**

**The Buddha once visited a small town called Kesaputta in the**
**kingdom of Kosala. The inhabitants of this town were known by**
**the common name Kalama. When they heard that the Buddha was**
**in their town, the Kalamas paid him a visit, and told him:**

**'Sir, there are some recluses and brahmanas who visit Kesaputta.**
**They explain and illumine only their own doctrines, and despise,**
**condemn and spurn others' doctrines. Then come other recluses**
**and brahmanas, and they, too, in their turn, explain and illumine**
**only their own doctrines, and despise, condemn and spurn others'**
**doctrines. But, for us, Sir, we have always doubt and perplexity**
**as to who among these venerable recluses and brahmanas spoke**
**the truth, and who spoke falsehood.'**

**Then the Buddha gave them this advice, unique in the history**
**of religions:**

**'Yes, Kalamas, it is proper that you have doubt, that you have**
**perplexity, for a doubt has arisen in a matter which is doubtful.**
**N o w, look you Kalamas, do not be led by reports, or tradition,**
**or hearsay. Be not led by the authority of religious texts, nor by**
**mere logic or inference, nor by considering appearances, nor by**
**the delight in speculative opinions, nor by seeming possibilities,**


**1**
_Sangha_ **lit. means 'Community'. But in Buddhism this term denotes 'The Com-**
**munity of Buddhist monks' which is the Order of Monks. Buddha,** _Dhamma_
**(Teaching) and** _Sangha_ **(Order) are known as** _Tisarana_ **'Three Refuges' or** _Tiratana_
**(Sanskrit** _Triratna)_ **'Triple-Gem'.**

**2**
**D II (Colombo, 1929), p. 62.**


**nor by the idea: 'this is our teacher'. But, O Kalamas, when,**
**you know for yourselves that certain things are unwholesome**
_(akusala_ **), and wrong, and bad, then give them up . . . A n d when**
**you know for yourselves that certain things are wholesome**
**and good, then accept them and follow them.'** **[1 ]**
_(kusala)_

**The Buddha went even further. He told the bhikkhus that a**
**disciple should examine even the Tathagata (Buddha) himself, so**
**that he (the disciple) might be fully convinced of the true value of**
**the teacher whom he followed.** **[2 ]**

**According to the Buddha's teaching, doubt (** _vicikiccha_ **) is one**
**of the five Hindrances (** _nivarana_ **)** **[3]** **to the clear understanding**
**of Truth and to spiritual progress (or for that matter to any**
**progress). Doubt, however, is not a 'sin', because there are no**
**articles of faith in Buddhism. In fact there is no 'sin' in Buddhism,**
**as sin is understood in some religions. The root of all evil is**
**ignorance (** _avijja_ **) and false views (** _micchd ditthi)._ **It is an undeniable**
**fact that as long as there is doubt, perplexity, wavering, no progress**
**is possible. It is also equally undeniable that there must be doubt**
**as long as one does not understand or see clearly. But in order to**
**progress further it is absolutely necessary to get rid of doubt. To**
**get rid of doubt one has to see clearly.**

**There is no point in saying that one should not doubt or one**
**should believe. Just to say 'I believe' does not mean that you under-**
**stand and see. When a student works on a mathematical problem,**
**he comes to a stage beyond which he does not know how to**
**proceed, and where he is in doubt and perplexity. As long as he**
**has this doubt, he cannot proceed. If he wants to proceed, he**
**must resolve this doubt. A n d there are ways of resolving that**
**doubt. Just to say 'I believe', or 'I do not doubt' will certainly not**
**solve the problem. To force oneself to believe and to accept** a
**thing without understanding is political, and not spiritual or**
**intellectual.**

**The Buddha was always eager to dispel doubt. Even just a few**
**minutes before his death, he requested his disciples several times**
**to ask him if they had any doubts about his teaching, and not to**

**feel sorry later that they could not clear those doubts. But the**
**disciples were silent. What he said then was touching: 'If it is**
**through respect for the Teacher that you do not ask anything, let**
**even one of you inform his friend' (i.e., let one tell his friend so**
**that the latter may ask the question on the other's behalf).** **[1 ]**

**Not only the freedom of thought, but also the tolerance allowed**
**by the Buddha is astonishing to the student of the history of**
**religions. Once in Nalanda a prominent and wealthy householder**
**named Upali, a well-known lay disciple of Nigantha Nataputta**
**(Jaina Mahavira), was expressly sent by Mahavira himself to meet**
**the Buddha and defeat him in argument on certain points in the**
**theory of Karma, because the Buddha's views on the subject were**
**different from those of Mahavira.** **[2]** **Quite contrary to expectations,**
**Upali, at the end of the discussion, was convinced that the views**
**of the Buddha were right and those of his master were wrong. So**
**he begged the Buddha to accept him as one of his lay disciples**
_(Vpasaka_ **). But the Buddha asked him to reconsider it, and not to**
**be in a hurry, for 'considering carefully is good for well-known**
**men like you'. When Upali expressed his desire again, the Buddha**
**requested him to continue to respect and support his old religious**
**teachers as he used to.** **[3 ]**

**In the third century B.C., the great Buddhist Emperor Asoka**
**of India, following this noble example of tolerance and under-**
**standing, honoured and supported all other religions in his vast**
**empire. In one of his Edicts carved on rock, the original of which**
**one may read even today, the Emperor declared:**

**'One should not honour only one's own religion and condemn**
**the religions of others, but one should honour others' religions for**
**this or that reason. So doing, one helps one's own religion to**
**grow and renders service to the religions of others too. In acting**
**otherwise one digs the grave of one's own religion and also does**
**harm to other religions. Whosoever honours his own religion and**
**condemns other religions, does so indeed through devotion to his**
**own religion, thinking "I will glorify my own religion". But on**
**the contrary, in so doing he injures his own religion more gravely.**

**So concord is good: Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the**
**doctrines professed by others'.** **[1 ]**

**We should add here that this spirit of sympathetic understanding**
**should be applied today not only in the matter of religious doc-**
**trine, but elsewhere as well.**

**This spirit of tolerance and understanding has been from the**
**beginning one of the most cherished ideals of Buddhist culture and**
**civilization. That is why there is not a single example of persecu-**
**tion or the shedding of a drop of blood in converting people to**
**Buddhism, or in its propagation during its long history of 2500**
**years. It spread peacefully all over the continent of Asia, having**
**more than 500 million adherents today. Violence in any form,**
**under any pretext whatsoever, is absolutely against the teaching of**
**the Buddha.**

**The question has often been asked: Is Buddhism a religion or a**
**philosophy? It does not matter what you call it. Buddhism re-**
**mains what it is whatever label you may put on it. The label is**
**immaterial. Even the label 'Buddhism' which we give to the**
**teaching of the Buddha is of little importance. The name one gives**
**it is inessential.**


**What's in a name ? That which we call a rose,**
**By any other name would smell as sweet.**


**In the same way Truth needs no label: it is neither Buddhist,**
**Christian, Hindu nor Moslem. It is not the monopoly of anybody.**
**Sectarian labels are a hindrance to the independent understanding**
**of Truth, and they produce harmful prejudices in men's minds.**

**This is true not only in intellectual and spiritual matters, but**
**also in human relations. When, for instance, we meet a man, we**
**do not look on him as a human being, but we put a label on him,**
**such as English, French, German, American, or Jew, and regard**
**him with all the prejudices associated with that label in our mind.**
**Yet he may be completely free from those attributes which we**
**have put on him.**

**People are so fond of discriminative labels that they even go**
**to the length of putting them on human qualities and emotions**
**common to all. So they talk of different 'brands' of charity, as for**
**example, of Buddhist charity or Christian charity, and look down**


**1**
**Rock Edict, XII.**

**other 'brands' of charity. But charity cannot be sectarian;**
upon
**it is neither Christian, Buddhist, Hindu nor Moslem. The love of**
a **mother for her child is neither Buddhist nor Christian: it is**
**mother love. Human qualities and emotions like love, charity,**
**compassion, tolerance, patience, friendship, desire, hatred, ill-will,**
**ignorance, conceit, etc., need no sectarian labels; they belong to**
n o **particular religions.**

**To the seeker after Truth it is immaterial from where an idea**
**comes. The source and development of an idea is a matter for the**
**academic. In fact, in order to understand Truth, it is not necessary**
**even to know whether the teaching comes from the Buddha, or**
**from anyone else. What is essential is seeing the thing, under-**
**standing it. There is an important story in the**
_Majjhima-nikaya_
**no. 140) which illustrates this.**
_(sutta_

**The Buddha once spent a night in a potter's shed. In the same**
**shed there was a young recluse who had arrived there earlier.** **[1 ]**

**They did not know each other.** **The Buddha observed the**
**recluse, and thought to himself: 'Pleasant are the ways of this**
**young man. It would be good if I should ask about him'. So the**
**Buddha asked him: 'O bhikkhu,** **[2]** **in whose name have you left**
**home ? Or who is your master ? Or whose doctrine do you like ?'**

**'O friend,' answered the young man, 'there is the recluse**
**Gotama, a Sakyan scion, who left the Sakya-family to become a**
**recluse. There is high repute abroad of him that he is an Arahant,**
**a Fully-Enlightened One. In the name of that Blessed One I have**
**become a recluse. He is my Master, and I like his doctrine'.**

**'Where does that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully-Enlight-**
**ened One live at the present time ?'**

**'In the countries to the north, friend, there is a city called**


**1**
**In India potters' sheds are spacious, and quiet. References are made in the Pali**
**texts to ascetics and recluses, as well as to the Buddha himself, spending a night in a**
**potter's shed during their wanderings.**

**2**
**It is interesting to note here that the Buddha addresses this recluse as** _bhikkhu,_
**which term is used for Buddhist monks. In the sequel it will be seen that he was not a**
**bhikkhu, not a member of the Order of the Sangha, for he asked the Buddha to**
**admit him into the Order. Perhaps in the days of the Buddha the term 'bhikkhu' was**
**used at times even for other ascetics indiscriminately, or the Buddha was not very**
**strict in the use of the term. Bhikkhu means 'mendicant' 'one who begs food', and**
**perhaps it was used here in its literal and original sense. But today the term 'bhikkhu'**
**is used only of Buddhist monks, especially in Theravada countries like Ceylon,**
**Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and in Chittagong.**

**Savatthi. It is there that that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully-**
**Enlightened One, is now living.'**

**'Have you ever seen him, that Blessed One ? Would you recog-**
**nize him if you saw him ?'**

**'I have never seen that Blessed One. Nor should I recognize**
**him if I saw him.'**

**The Buddha realized that it was in his name that this unknown**
**young man had left home and become a recluse. But without**
**divulging his own identity, he said: 'O bhikkhu, I will teach you**
**the doctrine. Listen and pay attention. I will speak.'**

**'Very well, friend,' said the young man in assent.**

**Then the Buddha delivered to this young man a most remark-**
**able discourse explaining Truth (the gist of which is given later).** **[1 ]**

**It was only at the end of the discourse that this young recluse,**
**whose name was Pukkusati, realized that the person who spoke**
**to him was the Buddha himself. So he got up, went before the**
**Buddha, bowed down at the feet of the Master, and apologized**
**to him for calling him 'friend'** **[2]** **unknowingly. He then begged the**
**Buddha to ordain him and admit him into the Order of the**
_Sangha._

**The Buddha asked him whether he had the alms-bowl and the**
**robes ready. (A bhikkhu must have three robes and the alms-bowl**
**for begging food.) When Pukkusati replied in the negative, the**
**Buddha said that the Tathagatas would not ordain a person unless**
**the alms-bowl and the robes were ready. So Pukkusati went out in**
**search of an alms-bowl and robes, but was unfortunately savaged**
**by a cow and died.** **[3 ]**

**Later, when this sad news reached the Buddha, he announced**
**that Pukkusati was a wise man, who had already seen Truth, and**

**In the chapter on the third Noble Truth, see p. 38.**

**The term used is** _Avuso_ **which means friend. It is a respectful term of address**
**among equals. But disciples never used this term addressing the Buddha. Instead they**
**use the term** _Bhante_ **which approximately means 'Sir' or 'Lord'. At the time of the**
**Buddha, the members of his Order of Monks (Sangha) addressed one another as**
_Avuso_ **'Friend'. But before his death the Buddha instructed younger monks to address**
**their elders as** _Bhante_ **'Sir' or** _Ayasma_ **'Venerable'. But elders should address the**
**younger members by name, or as** _Avuso_ **'Friend'. (D II Colombo, 1929, p. 95).**
**This practice is continued up to the present day in the Sangha.**

**It is well-known that cows in India roam about the streets. From this reference**
**it seems that the tradition is very old. But generally these cows are docile and not**
**savage or dangerous.**


**attained the penultimate stage in the realization of Nirvana, and**
**that he was born in a realm where he would become an Arahant** **[1 ]**

**and finally pass away, never to return to this world again** **[2]** **.**

**From this story it is quite clear that when Pukkusati listened to**
**the Buddha and understood his teaching, he did not know who**
**was speaking to him, or whose teaching it was. He saw Truth.**
**If the medicine is good, the disease will be cured. It is not neces-**
**sary to know who prepared it, or where it came from.**

**Almost all religions are built on faith—rather 'blind' faith it**
**would seem. But in Buddhism emphasis is laid on 'seeing',**
**knowing, understanding, and not on faith, or belief. In Buddhist**
**texts there is a word** **(Skt.** **which is usually**
_saddha_ _sraddha)_
**translated as 'faith' or 'belief'. But** **is not 'faith' as such, but**
_saddha_
**rather 'confidence' born out of conviction. In popular Buddhism**
**and also in ordinary usage in the texts the word** **it must be**
_saddha,_
**admitted, has an element of 'faith' in the sense that it signifies**
**devotion to the Buddha, the** **(Teaching) and the**
_Dhamma_ _Sangha_
**(The Order).**

**According to Asanga, the great Buddhist philosopher of the**
**4th century A.C.,** **has three aspects: (i) full and firm**
_sraddha_
**conviction that a thing is, (2) serene joy at good qualities, and (3)**
**aspiration or wish to achieve an object in view.** **[3 ]**

**However you put it, faith or belief as understood by most**
**religions has little to do with Buddhism.** **[4 ]**

**The question of belief arises when there is no seeing—seeing**
**in every sense of the word. The moment you see, the question of**
**belief disappears. If I tell you that I have a gem hidden in the**
**folded palm of my hand, the question of belief arises because you**



_1_
_An Arahant_ **is a person who has liberated himself from all defilements and impuri-**
**ties such as desire, hatred, ill-will, ignorance, pride, conceit, etc. He has attained the**
**fourth or the highest and ultimate stage in the realization of Nirvana, and is full of**
**wisdom, compassion and such pure and noble qualities. Pukkusati had attained at the**
**moment only the third stage which is technically called** _Anagami_ **'Never-Returner'.**
**The second stage is called** _Sakadagami_ **'Once-Returner' and the first stage is called**
_Sotapanna_ **'Stream-Entrant'.**

**do not see it yourself. But if I unclench my fist and show you the**
**gem, then you see it for yourself, and the question of belief does**
**not arise. So the phrase in ancient Buddhist texts reads: 'Realiz-**
**ing, as one sees a gem (or a myrobalan fruit) in the palm'.**

**A disciple of the Buddha named Musila tells another monk:**
**'Friend Savittha, without devotion, faith or belief,** **[1]** **without**
**liking or inclination,** **without hearsay or tradition,** **without**
**considering apparent reasons, without delight in the speculations**
**of opinions, I know and see that the cessation of becoming is**
**Nirvana.'** **[2 ]**

**And the Buddha says: 'O bhikkhus, I say that the destruction**
**of defilement and impurities is (meant) for a person who knows and**
**who sees, and not for a person who does not know and does not**
**see.'** **[3 ]**

**It is always a question of knowing and seeing, and not that of**
**believing. The teaching of the Buddha is qualified as** _ehi-passika,_
**inviting you to 'come and see', but not to come and believe.**

**The expressions used everywhere in Buddhist texts referring to**
**persons who realized Truth are: 'The dustless and stainless E y e**
**of Truth (** _Dhamma-cakkbu_ **) has arisen.' 'He has seen Truth, has**
**attained Truth, has known Truth, has penetrated into Truth, has**
**crossed over doubt, is without wavering.' 'Thus with right**
**wisdom he sees it as it is** _{ yatha bhutam)'A_ **With reference to his**
**own** **Enlightenment the** **Buddha** **said:** **'The eye was** **born,**
**knowledge was born, wisdom was born, science was born, light**
**was born.'** **[5]** **It is always seeing through knowledge or wisdom**
_(nana-dassana),_ **and not believing through faith.**

**This was more and more appreciated at a time when Brahmanic**
**orthodoxy intolerantly insisted on believing and accepting their**
**tradition and authority as the only Truth without question.**
**Once a group of learned and well-known Brahmins went to see**
**the Buddha and had a long discussion with him. One of the group,**
**a Brahmin youth of 16 years of age, named Kapathika, considered**

**by them all to be an exceptionally brilliant mind, put a question to**
**the Buddha**

**'Venerable Gotama, there are the ancient holy scriptures of the**
**Brahmins handed down along the line by unbroken oral tradition**
**of texts. With regard to them, Brahmins come to the absolute**
**conclusion: "This alone is Truth, and everything else is false".**
**N o w, what does the Venerable Gotama say about this ?'**

**The Buddha inquired: 'Among Brahmins is there any one**
**single Brahmin who claims that he personally knows and sees that**
**"This alone is Truth, and everything else is false." ?'**

**The young man was frank, and said: 'No'.**
**'Then, is there any one single teacher, or a teacher of teachers of**
**Brahmins back to the seventh generation, or even any one of**
**those original authors of those scriptures, who claims that he**
**knows and he sees: "This alone is Truth, and everything else is**
**false"?'**

**'No.'**
**'Then, it is like a line of blind men, each holding on to the**
**preceding one; the first one does not see, the middle one also**
**does not see, the last one also does not see. Thus, it seems to me**
**that the state of the Brahmins is like that of a line of blind men.'**

**Then the Buddha gave advice of extreme importance to the**
**group of Brahmins: 'It is not proper for a wise man who maintains**
**(lit. protects) truth to come to the conclusion: "This alone is**
**Truth, and everything else is false".'**

**Asked by the young Brahmin to explain the idea of maintaining**
**or protecting truth, the Buddha said: 'A man has a faith. If he**
**says "This is my faith", so far he maintains truth. But by that he**
**cannot proceed to the absolute conclusion: "This alone is Truth,**
**and everything else is false".' In other words, a man may believe**
**what he likes, and he may say 'I believe this'. So far he respects**
**truth. But because of his belief or faith, he should not say that**
**what he believes is alone the Truth, and everything else is false.**

**The Buddha says: ' T o be attached to one thing (to a certain**
**view) and to look down upon other things (views) as inferior—**
**this the wise men call a fetter.'** **[2 ]**

_Canki-sutta,_ **no. 95 of M.**

**Sn (PTS), p. 151 (v. 798).**


**Once the Buddha explained** **[1]** **the doctrine of cause and effect to**
**his disciples, and they said that they saw it and understood it**
**clearly. Then the Buddha said:**

**'O bhikkhus, even this view, which is so pure and so clear,**
**if you cling to it, if you fondle it, if you treasure it, if you are**
**attached to it, then you do not understand that the teaching is**
**similar to a raft, which is for crossing over, and not for getting**
**hold of.'2**

**Elsewhere the Buddha explains this famous simile in which his**
**teaching is compared to a raft for crossing over, and not for**
**getting hold of and carrying on one's back:**

**'O bhikkhus, a man is on a journey. He comes to a vast**
**stretch of water. On this side the shore is dangerous, but on the**
**other it is safe and without danger. No boat goes to the other**
**shore which is safe and without danger, nor is there any bridge**
**for crossing over. He says to himself: "This sea of water is vast,**
**and the shore on this side is full of danger; but on the other**
**shore it is safe and without danger. No boat goes to the other**
**side, nor is there a bridge for crossing over. It would be good**
**therefore if I would gather grass, wood, branches and leaves**
**to make a raft, and with the help of the raft cross over safely**
**to the other side, exerting myself with my hands and feet".**
**Then that man, O bhikkhus, gathers grass, wood, branches and**
**leaves and makes a raft, and with the help of that raft crosses over**
**safely to the other side, exerting himself with his hands and feet.**
**Having crossed over and got to the other side, he thinks: "This**
**raft was of great help to me. With its aid I have crossed safely over**
**to this side, exerting myself with my hands and feet. It would be**
**good if I carry this raft on my head or on my back wherever I g o " .**

**'What do you think, O bhikkhus, if he acted in this way would**
**that man be acting properly with regard to the raft ? " N o, Sir".**
**In which way then would he be acting properly with regard to**
**the raft ? Having crossed and gone over to the other side, suppose**
**that man should think: "This raft was a great help to me. With**
**its aid I have crossed safely over to this side, exerting myself with**
**my hands and feet. It would be good if I beached this raft on the**
**shore, or moored it and left it afloat, and then went on my way**


**1**
**In the** _Mahatanhasankhaya-sutta,_ **no. 38 of M.**

**2**
**M I (PTS), p. 260.**


**wherever it may be". Acting in this way would that man act**
**properly with regard to that raft.**

**'In the same manner, O bhikkhus, I have taught a doctrine**
**similar to a raft—it is for crossing over, and not for carrying (lit.**
**getting hold of). You, O bhikkhus, who understand that the**
**teaching is similar to a raft, should give up even good things**
_(dhamma)_ **; how much more then should you give up evil things**
_(adhamma).'_ _[1 ]_

**From this parable it is quite clear that the Buddha's teaching is**
**meant to carry man to safety, peace, happiness, tranquillity, the**
**attainment of** **The whole doctrine taught by the Buddha**
_Nirvana._
**leads to this end. He did not say things just to satisfy intellectual**
**curiosity. He was a practical teacher and taught only those things**
**which would bring peace and happiness to man.**

**The Buddha was once staying in a Simsapa forest in Kosambi**
**(near Allahabad). He took a few leaves into his hand, and asked his**
**disciples: 'What do you think, O bhikkhus? Which is more?**
**These few leaves** **in my hand or the leaves** **in the forest**
**over here ?'**

**'Sir, very few are the leaves in the hand of the Blessed One,**
**but indeed the leaves in the Simsapa forest over here are very**
**much more abundant.'**

**'Even so, bhikkhus, of what I have known I have told you only**
**a little, what I have not told you is very much more. A n d why**
**have I not told you (those things) ? Because that is not useful. . .**
**not leading to** **That is why I have not told you those**
_Nirvana._
**things.'** **[2 ]**

**It is futile, as some scholars vainly try to do, for us to specu-**
**late on what the Buddha knew but did not tell us.**

**The Buddha was not interested in discussing unnecessary**
**metaphysical questions which are purely speculative and which**
**create imaginary problems. He considered them as a 'wilderness**
**of opinions'. It seems that there were some among his own**
**disciples who did not appreciate this attitude of his. For, we have**


**1**
**MI (PTS), pp. 134-i 3 5.** _Dhamma_ **here, according to the Commentary, means high**
**spiritual attainments as well as pure views and ideas. Attachment even to these,**
**however high and pure they may be, should be given up; how much more then**
**should it be with regard to evil and bad things. MA II (PTS), p. 109.**

**2**
**S V (PTS), p. 457-**


**the example of one of them, Malunkyaputta by name, who**
**put to the Buddha ten well-known classical questions on meta-**
**physical problems and demanded answers.** **[1 ]**

**One day Malunkyaputta got up from his afternoon meditation,**
**went to the Buddha, saluted him, sat on one side and said:**

**'Sir, when I was all alone meditating, this thought occurred to**
**me: There are these problems unexplained, put aside and rejected**
**by the Blessed One. Namely, (i) is the universe eternal or (2)**
**is it not eternal, (3) is the universe finite or (4) is it infinite, (5)**
**is soul the same as body or (6) is soul one thing and body another**
**thing, (7) does the Tathagata exist after death, or (8) does he not**
**exist after death, or (9) does he both (at the same time) exist and**
**not exist after death, or (10) does he both (at the same time) not**
**exist and not not-exist. These problems the Blessed One does**
**not explain to me. This (attitude) does not please me, I do not**
**appreciate it. I will go to the Blessed One and ask him about this**
**matter. If the Blessed One explains them to me, then I will continue**
**to follow the holy life under him. If he does not explain them, I**
**will leave the Order and go away. If the Blessed One knows that**
**the universe is eternal, let him explain it to me so. If the Blessed**
**One knows that the universe is not eternal, let him say so. If the**
**Blessed One does not know whether the universe is eternal or**
**not, etc., then for a person who does not know, it is straight-**
**forward to say "I do not know, I do not see".'**


**The Buddha's reply to Malunkyaputta should do good to many**
**millions in the world today who are wasting valuable time on such**
**metaphysical questions and unnecessarily disturbing their peace**
**of mind:**

**'Did I ever tell you, Malunkyaputta, "Come, Malunkyaputta,**
**lead the holy life under me, I will explain these questions to you ?" '**

**'No, Sir.'**

**'Then, Malunkyaputta, even you, did you tell me: "Sir, I will**
**lead the holy life under the Blessed One, and the Blessed One will**
**explain these questions to m e " ?'**

**'No, Sir.'**
**'Even now, Malunkyaputta, I do not tell you: " C o m e and lead**
**the holy life under me, I will explain these questions to you".**


_1_
_Cula-Mdlurikja-sutta,_ **no. 63 of M.**


13


**And you do not tell me either: "Sir, I will lead the holy life under**
**the Blessed One, and he will explain these questions to me".**
**Under these circumstances, you foolish one, who refuses w h o m ?** **[1 ]**

**'Malunkyaputta, if anyone says: "I will not lead the holy life**
**under the Blessed One until he explains these questions," he may**
**die with these questions unanswered by the Tathagata. Suppose**
**Malunkyaputta, a man is wounded by a poisoned arrow, and his**
**friends and relatives bring him to a surgeon. Suppose the man**
**should then say: "I will not let this arrow be taken out until I know**
**who shot me; whether he is a Ksatriya (of the warrior caste) or a**
**Brahmana (of the priestly caste) or a Vaisya (of the trading and**
**agricultural caste) or a Sudra (of the low caste); what his name**
**and family may be; whether he is tall, short, or of medium stature;**
**whether his complexion is black, brown, or golden; from which**
**village, town or city he comes. I will not let this arrow be taken**
**out until I know the kind of bow with which I was shot; the**
**kind of bowstring used; the type of arrow; what sort of feather**
**was used on the arrow and with what kind of material the point of**
**the arrow was made." Malunkyaputta, that man would die without**
**knowing any of these things. Even so, Malunkyaputta, if anyone**
**says: "I will not follow the holy life under the Blessed One until he**
**answers these questions such as whether the universe is eternal**
**or not, etc.," he would die with these questions unanswered by**
**the Tathagata.'**


**Then the Buddha explains to Malunkyaputta that the holy life**
**does not depend on these views. Whatever opinion one may have**
**about these problems, there is birth, old age, decay, death, sorrow,**
**lamentation, pain, grief, distress, "the Cessation of which (i.e.**
_Nirvana_ **) I declare in this very life."**

**'Therefore, Malunkyaputta, bear in mind what I have explained**
**as explained, and what I have not explained as unexplained. What**
**are the things that I have not explained ? Whether the universe is**
**eternal or not, etc., (those 10 opinions) I have not explained.**
**Why, Malunkyaputta, have I not explained them? Because it is**
**not useful, it is not fundamentally connected with the spiritual**
**holy life, is not conducive to aversion, detachment, cessation,**
**tranquillity, deep penetration, full realization,** _Nirvana._ **That is**
**why I have not told you about them.**


**1**
**i.e., both are free and neither is under obligation to the other.**

**'Then, what, Malunkyaputta, have I explained ? I have explained**
_dukkha,_ **the arising** _oi dukkha_ **, the cessation of** _dukkha,_ **and the way**
**leading to the cessation of** _dukkha_ **-** **[1]** **Why, Malunkyaputta, have I**
**explained them ? Because it is useful, is fundamentally connected**
**with the spiritual holy life, is conducive to aversion, detachment,**
**cessation, tranquillity, deep penetration, full realization, Nirvana.**
**Therefore I have explained them.'** **[2 ]**

**Let us now examine the Four Noble Truths which the Buddha**
**told Malunkyaputta he had explained.**


**1**
**These Four Noble Truths are explained in the next four chapters.**

CHAPTER II
#### _The Four Noble Truths_


**T H E** **F I R S T** **N O B L E** **T R U T H :**
_DUKKHA_


**The heart of the Buddha's teaching lies in the Four Noble Truths**
**which** **he** **expounded** **in** **his** **very** **first**
_(Cattdri Ariyasaccant)_
**sermon** **[1]** **to his old colleagues, the five ascetics, at Isipatana**
**(modern Sarnath) near Benares. In this sermon, as we have it in the**
**original texts, these four Truths are given briefly. But there are**
**innumerable places in the early Buddhist scriptures where they**
**are explained again and again, with greater detail and in different**
**ways. If we study the Four Noble Truths with the help of these**
**references and explanations, we get a fairly good and accurate**
**account of the essential teachings of the Buddha according to the**
**original texts.**



**The Four Noble Truths are:**



_1._ _Dukkha_ _[2 ]_
**the arising or origin of**
_2. Samudaya,_ _dukkha,_



**3.** **the cessation of**
_Nirodha,_ _dukkha,_
**4.** **the way leading to the cessation of**
_Magga,_ _dukkha._



**THE FIRST NOBLE TRUTH:** _DUKKHA_

**The First Noble Truth (** _Dukkha-ariyasacca)_ **is generally trans-**
**lated by almost all scholars as 'The Noble Truth of Suffering', and**
**it is interpreted to mean that life according to Buddhism is nothing**
**but suffering and pain. Both translation and interpretation are**
**highly unsatisfactory and misleading. It is because of this limited,**
**free and easy translation, and its superficial interpretation, that**
**many people have been misled into regarding Buddhism as**
**pessimistic.**

**I do not wish to give an equivalent in English for this term for reasons given**
**below.**

**I. The bust of the Buddha—from Thailand**


**First of all, Buddhism is neither pessimistic nor optimistic. If**
**anything at all, it is realistic, for it takes a realistic view of life**
**and of the world. It looks at things objectively (** _yathabhutam)._
**It does not falsely lull you into living in a fool's paradise, nor**
**does it frighten and agonize you with all kinds of imaginary fears**
**and sins. It tells you exactly and objectively what you are and what**
**the world around you is, and shows you the way to perfect**
**freedom, peace, tranquillity and happiness.**

**One physician may gravely exaggerate an illness and give up**
**hope altogether. Another may ignorantly declare that there is no**
**illness and that no treatment is necessary, thus deceiving the patient**
**with a false consolation. Y o u may call the first one pessimistic**
**and the second optimistic. Both are equally dangerous. But a**
**third physician diagnoses the symptoms correctly, understands the**
**cause and the nature of the illness, sees clearly that it can be cured,**
**and courageously administers a course of treatment, thus saving**
**his patient. The Buddha is like the last physician. He is the wise**
**and scientific doctor for the ills of the world (** _Bhisakka_ **or**
_Bhaisajya-guru)._

**It is true that the Pali word** **(or Sanskrit** **in**
_dukkha_ _duhkha)_
**ordinary usage means 'suffering', 'pain', 'sorrow' or 'misery', as**
**opposed to the word** **meaning 'happiness', 'comfort' or**
_sukha_
**'ease'. But the term** **as the First Noble Truth, which re-**
_dukkha_
**presents the Buddha's view of life and the world, has a deeper**
**philosophical meaning and connotes enormously wider senses.**
**It is admitted that the term** **in the First Noble Truth con-**
_dukkha_
**tains, quite obviously, the ordinary meaning of 'suffering', but in**
**addition it also includes deeper ideas such as 'imperfection',**
**'impermanence', 'emptiness', 'insubstantiality'. It is difficult there-**
**fore to find one word to embrace the whole conception of the**
**term** **as the First Noble Truth, and so it is better to leave**
_dukkha_
**it untranslated, than to give an inadequate and wrong idea of it**
**by conveniently translating it as 'suffering' or 'pain'.**

**The Buddha does not deny happiness in life when he says there**
**is suffering. On the contrary he admits different forms of happiness,**
**both material and spiritual, for laymen as well as for monks. In**
**the** **one of the five original Collections in Pali**
_Anguttara-nikaya,_
**containing the Buddha's discourses, there is a list of happinesses**
**such as the happiness of family life and the happiness of**
_(sukhdni),_

17


18

**the life of a recluse, the happiness of sense pleasures and the**
**happiness of renunciation, the happiness of attachment and the**
**happiness of detachment, physical happiness and mental happiness**
**etc.** **[1]** **But all these are included in** **Even the very pure**
_dukkha._
**spiritual states of** **or trance) attained by the**
_dhyana (recueillement_
**practice of higher meditation, free from even a shadow of suffer-**
**ing in the accepted sense of the word, states which may be**
**described as unmixed happiness, as well as the state of**
_dhjana_
**which is free from sensations both pleasant (** _sukha_ **) and unpleasant'**
_(dukkha_ **) and is only pure equanimity and awareness—even these**
**very high spiritual states are included in** **In one of the**
_dukkha._
**of the** **(again one of the five original**
_suttas_ _Majjhima-nikdya,_
**Collections), after praising the spiritual happiness of these**
_dhyanas,_
**the Buddha says that they are 'impermanent,** _dukkha_ **, and subject to**
**change' (** _anicca dukkha viparinamadbamma_ **).** **[2]** **Notice that the word**
**is explicitly used. It is** **not because there is 'suffering'**
_dukkha_ _dukkha,_
**in the ordinary sense of the word, but because 'whatever is imper-**
**manent is**
_dukkha' (yad aniccam tam dukkham)._

**The Buddha was realistic and objective. He says, with regard to**
**life and the enjoyment of sense-pleasures, that one** **should**
**clearly understand three things:** **(I)** **attraction or enjoyment**
_(assada_ **), (2) evil consequence or danger or unsatisfactoriness**
_(adinava_ **), and (3) freedom or liberation (** _nissarana_ **).** **[3]** **When you**
**see a pleasant, charming and beautiful person, you like him (or**
**her), you are attracted, you enjoy seeing that person again and**
**again, you derive pleasure and satisfaction from that person. This**
**is enjoyment** **It is a fact of experience. But this enjoyment**
_(assada)._
**is not permanent, just as that person and all his (or her) attractions**
**are not permanent either. When the situation changes, when you**
**cannot see that person, when you are deprived of this enjoyment,**
**you** **become** **sad,** **you may** **become** **unreasonable** **and** **un-**
**balanced, you may even behave foolishly. This is the evil, unsatis-**
**factory and dangerous side of the picture** **This, too, is a**
_(adinava)._
**fact of experience. N o w if you have no attachment to the person,**
**if you are completely detached, that is freedom,** **liberation**



**1**
**A (Colombo, 1929), p. 49.**

_Mahadukkhakkhandha-sutta,_ **M I (PTS), p. 90.**



**3**
**M I (PTS), p. 85 ff; S HI (PTS), p. 27** _S._


_(nissarana_ **). These three things are true with regard to all enjoy-**
**ment in life.**

**From this it is evident that it is no question of pessimism or**
**optimism, but that we must take account of the pleasures of life**
**as well as of its pains and sorrows, and also of freedom from them,**
**in order to understand life completely and objectively. Only then**
**is true liberation possible. Regarding this question the Buddha**
**says:**

**'O bhikkhus, if any recluses or brahmanas do not understand**
**objectively in this way that the enjoyment of sense-pleasures is**
**enjoyment, that their unsatisfactoriness is unsatisfactoriness, that**
**liberation from them is liberation, then it is not possible that they**
**themselves will certainly understand the desire for sense-pleasures**
**completely, or that they will be able to instruct another person to**
**that end, or that the person following their instruction will comp-**
**letely understand the desire for sense-pleasures. But, O bhikkhus, if**
**any recluses or brahmanas understand objectively in this way that**
**the enjoyment of sense-pleasures is enjoyment, that their unsatis-**
**factoriness is unsatisfactoriness, that liberation from them is libera-**
**tion, then it is possible that they themselves will certainly under-**
**stand the desire for sense-pleasures completely, and that they will**
**be able to instruct another person to that end, and that that person**
**following their instruction will completely understand the desire**
**for sense-pleasures.'** **[1 ]**

**The conception of** **may be viewed from three aspects:**
_dukkha_
**(i)** _dukkha_ **as ordinary suffering (** _dukkha-dukkha_ **), (2)** _dukkha_ **as**
**produced by change (v** _iparinama-dukkha_ **) and (3)** _dukkha_ **as con-**
**ditioned states (** _samkhara-dukkha)._ _[2 ]_

**All kinds of suffering in life like birth, old age, sickness, death,**
**association with unpleasant persons and conditions, separation**
**from beloved ones and pleasant conditions, not getting what one**
**desires, grief, lamentation, distress—all such forms of physical**
**and mental suffering, which are universally accepted as suffering**
**or pain, are included in** _dukkha_ **as ordinary suffering (** _dukkha-_
_dukkha)._



**1**

**2** **M I (PTS), p. 87.**
**Vism (PTS), p. 499; Abhisamuc, p. 38.**


**A happy feeling, a happy condition in life, is not permanent, not**
**everlasting. It changes sooner or later. When it changes, it pro-**
**duces pain, suffering, unhappiness. This vicissitude is included in**
_dukkha_ **as suffering produced by change (** _viparinama-dukkha)._

**It is easy to understand the two forms of suffering**
_(dukkha)_
**mentioned above. No one will dispute them. This aspect of the**
**First Noble Truth is more popularly known because it is easy to**
**understand. It is common experience in our daily life.**

**But the third form of** **as conditioned states**
_dukkha_ _(samkhara-_
**is the most important philosophical aspect of the First**
_dukkha)_
**Noble Truth, and it requires some analytical explanation of what**
**we consider as a 'being', as an 'individual', or as 'I'.**

**What we call a 'being', or an 'individual', or T, according to**
**Buddhist philosophy, is only a combination of ever-changing**
**physical and mental forces or energies, which may be divided into**
**five groups or aggregates** **The Buddha says: 'In**
_(pancakkhandha)._
**short these five aggregates of attachment are** **Elsewhere**
_dukkha\_ **[1]**
**he distinctly defines** **as the five aggregates: ' O bhikkhus,**
_dukkha_
**what is** **? It should be said that it is the five aggregates of**
_dukkha_
**attachment'.** **[2]** **Here it should be clearly understood that** **and**
_dukkha_
**the five aggregates are not two different things; the five aggre-**
**gates themselves are** **W e will understand this point better**
_dukkha._
**when we have some notion of the five aggregates which constitute**
**the so-called 'being'. N o w, what are these five ?**


_The Five Aggregates_

**The first is the Aggregate of Matter (** _"Mpakkhandha)._ **In this term**
**'Aggregate of Matter' are included the traditional Four Great**
**Elements** **namely, solidity, fluidity, heat and**
_(cattari mahdbhutani),_
**motion, and also the Derivatives** **of the Four Great**
_(upadaja-riipa)_
**Elements.** **[3]** **In the term 'Derivatives of Four Great Elements' are**
**included our five material sense-organs, i.e., the faculties of**
**eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, and their corresponding**
**objects in the external world, i.e., visible form, sound, odour, taste,**


_1_
_Samkhittena pancupadanakkhandha dukkha._ **S V (PTS), p. 421.**


**3**
**S III (PTS), p. 59.**


20


**and tangible things, and also some thoughts or ideas or concep-**
**tions which are in the sphere of mind-objects** _(dharmdyatana)_ **[1]** **. Thus**
**the whole realm of matter, both internal and external, is included**
**in the Aggregate of Matter.**

**The second is the Aggregate of Sensations (** _Vedanakkhandhd)._
**In this group are included all our sensations, pleasant or unplea-**
**sant or neutral, experienced through the contact of physical and**
**mental organs with the external world. They are of six kinds:**
**the sensations experienced through the contact of the eye with**
**visible forms, ear with sounds, nose with odour, tongue with**
**taste, body with tangible objects, and mind (which is the sixth**
**faculty in Buddhist Philosophy) with mind-objects or thoughts or**
**ideas.** **[2]** **All our physical and mental sensations are included in this**
**group.**

**A word about what is meant by the term 'Mind'** **in**
_(manas)_
**Buddhist philosophy may be useful here. It should clearly be**
**understood that mind is not spirit as opposed to matter. It should**
**always be remembered that Buddhism does not recognize a spirit**
**opposed to matter, as is accepted by most other systems of**
**philosophies and religions. Mind is only a faculty or organ**
_(indriya_ **) like the eye or the ear. It can be controlled and developed**
**like any other faculty, and the Buddha speaks quite often of the**
**value of controlling and disciplining these six faculties. The**
**difference between the eye and the mind as faculties is that the**
**former senses the world of colours and visible forms, while the**
**latter senses the world of ideas and thoughts and mental objects.**
**We experience different fields of the world with different senses.**
**We cannot hear colours, but we can see them. N o r can we see**
**sounds, but we can hear them. Thus with our five physical sense-**
**organs—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body—we experience only the**
**world of visible forms, sounds, odours, tastes and tangible**
**objects. But these represent only a part of the world, not the whole**
**world. What of ideas and thoughts ? They are also a part of the**
**world. But they cannot be sensed, they cannot be conceived by**
**the faculty of the eye, ear, nose, tongue or body. Y e t they can be**
**conceived by another faculty, which is mind. N o w ideas and**

**2**
**S III (PTS), p. 59.**


21


**thoughts are not independent of the world experienced by these**
**five physical sense faculties. In fact they depend on, and are**
**conditioned by, physical experiences. Hence a person born blind**
**cannot have ideas of colour, except through the analogy of sounds**
**or some other things experienced through his other faculties.**
**Ideas and thoughts which form a part of the world are thus**
**produced and conditioned by physical experiences and are con-**
**ceived by the mind. Hence mind (** _manas_ **) is considered a sense**
**faculty or organ (** _indriya_ **), like the eye or the ear.**

**The third is the Aggregate of Perceptions (** _Sannakkhandha)._
**Like sensations, perceptions also are of six kinds, in relation to six**
**internal faculties and the corresponding six external objects. Like**
**sensations, they are produced through the contact of our six**
**faculties with the external world. It is the perceptions that recog-**
**nize objects whether physical or mental.** **[1 ]**

**The fourth is the Aggregate of Mental Formations** **[2]** **(** _Samkharak-_
_khandha)._ **In this group are included all volitional activities both**
**good and bad. What is generally known as** _karma_ **(or** _kamma)_
**comes under this group. The Buddha's own definition of** _karma_
**should be remembered here: ' O bhikkhus, it is volition (** _cetana)_
**that I call** _karma._ **Having willed, one acts through body, speech**
**and mind.'** **[3]** **Volition is 'mental construction, mental activity.**
**Its function is to direct the mind in the sphere of good, bad or**
**neutral activities.'** **[4]** **Just like sensations and perceptions, volition**
**is of six kinds, connected with the six internal faculties and the**
**corresponding six objects (both physical and mental) in the external**
**world.** **[5]** **Sensations and perceptions are not volitional actions.**
**They do not produce karmic effects. It is only volitional actions—**
**such** **as** **attention (** _manasikdra_ **),** **will (** _chanda_ **),** **determination**
_(adhimokkha_ **), confidence (** _saddha_ **), concentration (** _samadhi_ **), wisdom**
_(pahha_ **), energy (** _viriya_ **), desire (** _raga_ **), repugnance or hate (** _patigha)_

**'MentaI Formations' is a term now generally used to represent the wide meaning**
**of the word** _samkhara_ **in the list of Five Aggregates.** _Samkhara_ **in other contexts may**
**mean anything conditioned, anything in the world, in which sense all the Five**
**Aggregates are** _samkhara._

**jDCtncc (** _avijja_ **), conceit (** _mana_ **), idea of self (** _sakkaya-ditthi_ **) etc.**
**tlml can produce karmic effects. There are 52 such mental**
**llviiics which constitute the Aggregate of Mental Formations.**
**The l ifthis the Aggregate of Consciousness** _(Vinnattakkhandha)._ _[1 ]_

**Eonnciousness is a reaction or response which has one of the six**
**•pultics (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind) as its basis, and**
**One of the six corresponding external phenomena (visible form,**
**(omul, odour, taste, tangible things and mind-objects, i.e., an**
**Idea or thought) as its object. For instance, visual conscious-**
**ness (** _cakkhu-vinnana_ **) has the eye as its basis and a visible form as**
**lis object. Mental consciousness (** _mano-vihhana_ **) has the mind**
_(manas)_ **as its basis and a mental object, i.e., an idea or thought**

_[dhamma)_ **as its object. So consciousness is connected with other**
**faculties. Thus, like sensation, perception and volition, conscious-**
**ness also is of six kinds, in relation to six internal faculties and**
**(1 >1 responding six external objects.** **[2 ]**

**It should be clearly understood that consciousness does not**
**rec ognize an object. It is only a sort of awareness—awareness of**
**the presence of an object. When the eye comes in contact with a**
**colour, for instance blue, visual consciousness arises which simply**
**is awareness of the presence of a colour; but it does not recognize**
**that it is blue. There is no recognition at this stage. It is percepdon**
**(the third Aggregate discussed above) that recognizes that it is**
**blue. The term 'visual consciousness' is a philosophical expression**
**denoting the same idea as is conveyed by the ordinary word**
**'seeing'. Seeing does not mean recognizing. So are the other**
**forms of consciousness.**

**It must be repeated here that according to Buddhist philosophy**
**there is no permanent, unchanging spirit which can be considered**
**'Self', or 'Soul', or 'Ego', as opposed to matter, and that con-**
**sciousness (** _vinnana_ **) should not be taken as 'spirit' in opposition to**
**matter. This point has to be particularly emphasized, because a**
**wrong notion that consciousness is a sort of Self or Soul that**


**1**
**According to Mahayana Buddhist philosophy the Aggregate of Consciousness**
**has three aspects:** _citta, manas_ **and** _vijiidna,_ **and the** _Alaya-vijnana_ **(popularly translated**
**as 'Store-Consciousness') finds its place in this Aggregate. A detailed and comparative**
**study of this subject will be found in a forthcoming work on Buddhist philosophy**
**by the present writer.**

**2**
**S III (PTS), p. 61.**


23


**continues as a permanent substance through life, has persisted**
**from the earliest time to the present day.**

**One of the Buddha's own disciples, Sati by name, held that the**
**Master taught: 'It is the same consciousness that transmigrates**
**and wanders about.' The Buddha asked him what he meant by**
**'consciousness'. Sati's reply is classical: 'It is that which expresses,**
**which feels, which experiences the results of good and bad deeds**
**here and there'.**

**' T o whomever, you stupid one', remonstrated the Master, 'have**
**you heard me expounding the doctrine in this manner ? Haven't**
**I in many ways explained consciousness as arising out of condi-**
**tions: that there is no arising of consciousness without con-**
**ditions.' Then the Buddha went on to explain consciousness**
**in detail: 'Conciousness is named according to whatever con-**
**dition through which it arises: on account of the eye and visible**
**forms arises a consciousness, and it is called visual consciousness;**
**on account of the ear and sounds arises a consciousness, and it is**
**called auditory consciousness;** **on** **account of the nose** **and**
**odours arises a consciousness, and it is called olfactory con-**
**sciousness ; on account of the tongue and tastes arises a conscious-**
**ness, and it is called gustatory consciousness; on account of the**
**body and tangible objects arises a consciousness, and it is called**
**tactile consciousness; on account of the mind and mind-objects**
**(ideas and thoughts) arises a consciousness, and it is called mental**
**consciousness.'**


**Then the Buddha explained it further by an illustration: A**
**fire is named according to the material on account of which it**
**burns. A fire may burn on account of wood, and it is called wood-**
**fire. It may burn on account of straw, and then it is called straw-**
**fire. So consciousness is named according to the condition through**
**which it arises.** **[1 ]**

**Dwelling on this point, Buddhaghosa, the great commentator,**
**explains: '. . . a fire that burns on account of wood burns only**
**when there is a supply, but dies down in that very place when it**
**(the supply) is no longer there, because then the condition has**
**changed, but (the fire) does not cross over to splinters, etc., and**


_l_
_Mabatanhasamkhaya-sulta,_ **M I (PTS), p. 256 ff.**

_24_


**become a splinter-fire and so on; even so the consciousness that**
**arises on account of the eye and visible forms arises in that gate**
**of sense organ (i.e., in the eye), only when there is the condition of**
**the eye, visible forms, light and attention, but ceases then and**
**there when it (the condition) is no more there, because then the**
**condition has changed, but (the consciousness) does not cross**
**over to the ear, etc., and become auditory consciousness and so**
**on . .**

**The Buddha declared in unequivocal terms that consciousness**
**depends on matter, sensation, perception and mental formations,**
**and that it cannot exist independently of them. He says:**

**'Consciousness may exist having matter as its means (** _riipupayam),_
**matter as its object** **matter as its support**
_(rupdrammanani),_ _(rupa-_
**and seeking delight it may grow, increase and develop;**
_patittham),_
**or consciousness may exist having sensation as its means . . . or**
**perception as its means . . . or mental formations as its means,**
**mental formations as its object, mental formations as its support,**
**and seeking delight it may grow, increase and develop.**

**'Were a man to say: I shall show the coming, the going, the**
**passing away, the arising, the growth, the increase or the**
**development of consciousness** **apart from matter,** **sensation,**
**perception and mental formations, he would be speaking of some-**
**thing that does not exist.'** **[2 ]**

**Very briefly these are the five Aggregates. What we call a**
**'being', or an 'individual', or T, is only a convenient name or a**
**label given to the combination of these five groups. They are all**
**impermanent, all constantly changing. 'Whatever is impermanent**
**is** **This is the true meaning of**
_dukkha(Yad aniccam tam dukkham)._
**the Buddha's words: 'In brief the five Aggregates of Attachment**
**are** _dukkha_ **.' They are not the same for two consecutive moments.**
**Here A is not equal to A. They are in a flux of momentary arising**
**and disappearing.**

**'O Brahmana, it is just like a mountain river, flowing far and swift,**
**taking everything along with it; there is no moment, no instant,**
**no second when it stops flowing, but it goes on flowing and**


**1**
**MA II (PTS), pp. 306-307.**

**2**
**S III (PTS), p. 58.**

25


**continuing. So Brahmana, is human life, like a mountain river.'** **[1 ]**

**As the Buddha told Ratthapala: 'The world is in continuous flux**
**and is impermanent.'**

**One thing disappears, conditioning the appearance of the next**
**in a series of cause and effect. There is no unchanging substance**
**in them. There is nothing behind them that can be called a per-**
**manent Self** **individuality, or anything that can in reality**
_(Atmari),_
**be called T. Every one will agree that neither matter, nor sensa-**
**tion, nor perception, nor any one of those mental activities, nor**
**consciousness can really be called 'I'.** **[2]** **But when these five physical**
**and mental aggregates which are interdependent are working**
**together in combination as a physio-psychological machine,** **[3 ]**

**we get the idea of T. But this is only a false idea, a mental forma-**
**tion, which is nothing but one of those 52 mental formations**
**of the fourth Aggregate which we have just discussed, namely,**
**it is the idea of self (** _sakkaya-ditthi)._

**These five Aggregates together, which we popularly call a**
**'being', are** _dukkha_ **itself (** _samkhara-dukkha_ **). There is no other**
**'being' or 'I', standing behind these five aggregates, who experi-**
**ences** **A s Buddhaghosa says:**
_dukkha._

**'Mere suffering exists, but no sufferer is found;**

**The deeds are, but no doer is found.'** **[4 ]**

**There is no unmoving mover behind the movement. It is only**
**movement. It is not correct to say that life is moving, but life is**
**movement itself. Life and movement are not two different things.**
**In other words, there is no thinker behind the thought. Thought**
**itself is the thinker. If you remove the thought, there is no thinker**
**to be found. Here we cannot fail to notice how this Buddhist view**
**is diametrically opposed to the Cartesian** **'I think,**
_cogito ergo sum:_
**therefore I am.'**

**N o w a question may be raised whether life has a beginning.**



_**1**_
_**A**_ **(Colombo, 1929), p. 700. These words are attributed by the Buddha to a**
**Teacher (** _Sattba_ **) named Araka who was free from desires and who lived in the dim**
**past. It is interesting to remember here the doctrine of Heraclitus (about 500 B.C.)**
**that everything is in a state of flux, and his famous statement: 'You cannot step twice**
**into the same river, for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.'**

**According to the Buddha's teaching the beginning of the life-**
**stream of living beings is unthinkable. The believer in the creation**
**of life by G o d may be astonished at this reply. But if you were to**
**ask him 'What is the beginning of G o d ?' he would answer without**
**hesitation ' G o d has no beginning', and he is not astonished at his**
**own reply. The Buddha says: 'O bhikkhus, this cycle of continuity**
**is without a visible end, and the first beginning of beings**
_(samsara)_
**wandering and running round, enveloped in ignorance (** _avijjd)_
**and bound down by the fetters of thirst (desire,** **is not to be**
_tanha)_
**perceived.'** **[1]** **A n d further, referring to ignorance which is the main**
**cause of the continuity of life the Buddha states: 'The first begin-**
**ning of ignorance** **is not to be perceived in such a way as to**
_(avijjd)_
**postulate that there was no ignorance beyond a certain point.'** **[2 ]**

**Thus it is not possible to say that there was no life beyond a**
**certain definite point.**

**This in short is the meaning of the Noble Truth of**
_Dukkha._
**It is extremely important to understand this First Noble Truth**
**clearly because, as the Buddha says, 'he who sees** **sees also**
_dukkha_
**the arising of** **sees also the cessation of** **and sees**
_dukkha,_ _dukkha,_
**also the path leading to the cessation of**
_dukkha.'_ _[3 ]_

**This does not at all make the life of a Buddhist melancholy or**
**sorrowful, as some people wrongly imagine. On the contrary,**
**a true Buddhist is the happiest of beings. He has no fears or**
**anxieties. He is always calm and serene, and cannot be upset or**
**dismayed by changes or calamities, because he sees things as they**
**are. The Buddha was never melancholy or gloomy. He was**
**described** **by** **his** **contemporaries** **as** **'ever-smiling'**
_(mihita-_
**In Buddhist painting and sculpture the Buddha is**
_pubbamgama)._
**always represented with a countenance happy, serene, contented**
**and compassionate. Never a trace of suffering or agony or pain**
**is to be seen.** **[4]** **Buddhist art and architecture, Buddhist temples**

**S II (PTS),**

**S V (PTS), p. 437. In fact the Buddha says that he who sees any one of the Four**
**Noble Truths sees the other three as well. These Four Noble Truths are inter-**
**connected.**

**There is a statue from Gandhara, and also one from Fou-Kien, China, depicting**
**Gotama as an ascetic, emaciated, with all his ribs showing. But this was before his**
**Enlightenment, when he was submitting himself to the rigorous ascetic practices**
**which he condemned after he became Buddha.**

**never give the impression of gloom or sorrow, but produce an**
**atmosphere of calm and serene joy.**

**Although there is suffering in life, a Buddhist should not be**
**gloomy over it, should not be angry or impatient at it. One of the**
**principal evils in life, according to Buddhism, is 'repugnance' or**
**hatred. Repugnance (** _pratigha_ **) is explained as 'ill-will with regard**
**to living beings, with regard to suffering and wit'** **regard to things**
**pertaining to suffering. Its function is to produce a basis for un-**
**happy states and bad conduct.'** **[1]** **Thus it is wrong to be impatient at**
**suffering. Being impatient or angry at suffering does not remove it.**
**On the contrary, it adds a little more to one's troubles, and aggra-**
**vates and exacerbates a situation already disagreeable. What is**
**necessary is not anger or impatience, but the understanding of**
**the question of suffering, how it comes about, and how to get**
**rid of it, and then to work accordingly with patience, intelligence,**
**determination and energy.**

**There are two ancient Buddhist texts called the** **and**
_Theragatha_
**which are full of the joyful utterances of the Buddha's**
_Therigatha_
**disciples, both male and female, who found peace and happiness**
**in life through his teaching. The king of Kosala once told the**
**Buddha that unlike many a disciple of other religious systems who**
**looked haggard, coarse, pale, emaciated and unprepossessing, his**
**disciples were 'joyful and elated (** _hattha-pahattha_ **), jubilant and**
**exultant (** _udaggudagga_ **), enjoying the spiritual life (** _abhiratariipa),_
**with faculties pleased** **free from anxiety**
_(pinitindrija),_ _(appossukka),_
**serene** _(pannaloma_ **),** **peaceful** _(paradavutta_ **)** **and** **living** **with** **a**
**gazelle's mind** **i.e., light-hearted.' The king**
_(migabhiitena cetasa),_
**added that he believed that this healthy disposition was due to the**
**fact that 'these venerable ones had certainly realized the great**
**and full significance of the Blessed One's teaching.'** **[2 ]**

**Buddhism is quite opposed to the melancholic, sorrowful,**
**penitent and gloomy attitude of mind which is considered a**
**hindrance to the realization of Truth. On the other hand, it is**
**interesting to remember here that joy** **is one of the seven**
_(piti)_
**or 'Factors of Enlightenment', the essential qualities to**
_Bojjbamgas_
**be cultivated for the realization of Nirvana.** **[3 ]**

CHAPTER III


**T H E** **S E C O N D** **N O B L E** **T R U T H :**


**'The** **Arising** **of**
_S AMU DAY A:_ _Dukkba'_


**The Second Noble Truth is that of the arising or origin of**
_dukkha_
_(Dukkhasamudaja-arijasacca_ **). The most popular and well-known**
**definition of the Second Truth as found in innumerable places in**
**the original texts runs as follows:**

**'It is this "thirst" (craving,** **which produces re-existence**
_tanha)_
**and re-becoming (** _ponobhavika_ **), and which is bound up with**
**passionate greed (** _nandiragasahagata_ **), and which finds fresh delight**
**now here and now there (** _tatratatrabhinandini),_ **namely, (i) thirst**
**for sense-pleasures (** _kama-tanha_ **), (2) thirst for existence and be-**
**coming** _(1bhava-tanha_ **) and (3) thirst for non-existence (self-**
**annihilation,**
_vibhava-tanha).'_ _[1 ]_

**It is this 'thirst', desire, greed, craving, manifesting itself in**
**various ways, that gives rise to all forms of suffering and the**
**continuity of beings. But it should not be taken as the first cause,**
**for there is no first cause possible as, according to Budd-**
**hism, everything is** **relative and inter-dependent.** **Even this**
**'thirst',** **which is considered as the cause or origin of**
_tanha,_
_dukkha,_ **depends for its arising (** _samudaja)_ **on something else,**
**which is sensation (** _vedana_ **),** **[2]** **and sensation arises depending on con-**
**tact (** _phassa_ **), and so on and so forth goes on the circle which is**
**known as Conditioned Genesis (** _Paticca-samuppada_ **), which we will**
**discuss later.** **[3 ]**

**So** **'thirst', is not the first or the only cause of the arising**
_tanha,_
**of** **But it is the most palpable and immediate cause, the**
_dukkha._
**'principal thing' and the 'all-pervading thing'.** **[4]** **Hence in certain**

**places of the original Pali texts themselves the definition of**
**or the origin of** **includes other defilements and**
_samudaya_ _dukkha_
**impurities (** _kilesa, sasava dhamma),_ **in addition to** _tanha_ **'thirst'**
**which is always given the first place.** **[1]** **Within the necessarily**
**limited space of our discussion, it will be sufficient if we remember**
**that this 'thirst' has as its centre the false idea of self arising out of**
**ignorance.**

**Here the term 'thirst' includes not only desire for, and attachment**
**to, sense-pleasures, wealth and power, but also desire for, and**
**attachment to, ideas and ideals, views, opinions, theories, concep-**
**tions and** **beliefs** **According to the Buddha's**
_(dhamma-tanha)._ _[2]_
**analysis, all the troubles and strife in the world, from little**
**personal quarrels in families to great wars between nations and**
**countries, arise out of this selfish 'thirst'.** **[3]** **From this point of**
**view, all economic, political and social problems are rooted in this**
**selfish 'thirst'. Great statesmen who try to settle international**
**disputes and talk of war and peace only in economic and political**
**terms touch the superficialities, and never go deep into the**
**real root of the problem. As the Buddha told Rattapala: 'The**
**world lacks and hankers, and is enslaved to "thirst"**
_(tanhadaso).'_

**Every one will admit that all the evils in the world are produced**
**by selfish desire. This is not difficult to understand. But how this**
**desire, 'thirst', can produce re-existence and re-becoming**
_(pono-_
**is a problem not so easy to grasp. It is here that we have**
_bhavika)_
**to discuss the deeper philosophical side of the Second Noble Truth**
**corresponding to the philosophical side of the First Noble Truth.**
**Here we must have some idea about the theory of** **and**
_karma_
**rebirth.**

**There are four Nutriments** **in the sense of 'cause' or**
_(ahara)_
**'condition' necessary for the existence and continuity of beings:**
**(i) ordinary material food** **contact of our**
_(kabalinkdrahara), (z)_
**sense-organs (including mind) with the external world**
_(phassahara),_
**(3) consciousness (** _vinnanahara)_ **and (4) mental volition or will**
_(manosancetanahara)._ _[4 ]_

**Of these four, the last mentioned 'mental volition' is the will**
**to live, to exist, to re-exist, to continue, to become more and**
**more.** **[1]** **It creates the root of existence and continuity, striving**
**forward by way of good and bad actions (** _kusalakusalakamma)._ _[2 ]_

**It is the same as 'Volition' (** _cetana_ **).** **[3]** **W e have seen earlier** **[4]** **that**
**volition is karma, as the Buddha himself has defined it. Referring**
**to 'Mental volition' just mentioned above the Buddha says:**
**'When one understands the nutriment of mental volition one**
**understands the three forms of 'thirst' (** _tanha_ **).'** **[6]** **Thus the terms**
**'thirst', 'volition', 'mental volition' and 'karma' all denote the**
**same thing: they denote the desire, the will to be, to exist, to**
**re-exist, to become more and more, to grow more and more, to**
**accumulate more and more. This is the cause of the arising of**
**and this is found within the Aggregate of Mental For-**
_dukkha,_
**mations, one of the Five Aggregates which constitute a being.** **[6 ]**

**Here is one of the most important and essential points in the**
**Buddha's teaching. We must therefore clearly and carefully mark**
**and remember that the cause, the germ, of the arising of**
_dukkha_
**is within** **itself, and not outside; and we must equally**
_dukkha_
**well remember that the cause, the germ, of the cessation of**
_dukkha,_
**of the destruction of** **is also within** **itself, and not**
_dukkha,_ _dukkha_
**outside. This is what is meant by the well-known formula**
**often found in original Pali texts:**
_Yam kind samudajadhammam_
**'Whatever is of the nature of arising,**
_sabbam tarn nirodhadhammam_
**all that is of the nature of cessation.'** **[7]** **A being, a thing, or a system,**
**if it has within itself the nature of arising, the nature of coming**
**into being, has also within itself the nature, the germ, of its own**
**cessation and destruction. Thus** **(Five Aggregates) has**
_dukkha_
**within itself the nature of its own arising, and has also within**

**It is interesting to compare this 'mental volition' with 'libido' in modern psychol-**

**itself the nature of its own cessation. This point will be taken up**
**again in the discussion of the Third Noble Truth,**
_Nirodha._

**N o w, the Pali word** **or the Sanskrit word** **(from**
_kamma_ _karma_
**the root** _kr_ **to do) literally means 'action', 'doing'. But in the Budd-**
**hist theory of karma it has a specific meaning: it means only**
**'volitional action', not all action. N o r does it mean the result of**
**karma as many people wrongly and loosely use it. In Buddhist**
**terminology karma never means its effect; its effect is known as the**
**'fruit' or the 'result' of karma (** _kamma-phala_ **or** _kamma-vipaka)._

**Volition may relatively be good or bad, just as a desire may**
**relatively be good or bad. So karma may be good or bad rela-**
**tively. G o o d karma (** _kusala_ **) produces** **good effects,** **and bad**
**karma (** _akusala_ **) produces bad effects. 'Thirst', volition, karma,**
**whether good or bad, has one force as its effect: force to con-**
**tinue—to continue in a good or bad direction. Whether good or**
**bad it is relative, and is within the cycle of continuity**
_(samsara)._
**An Arahant, though he acts, does not accumulate karma, because**
**he is free from the false idea of self, free from the 'thirst' for**
**continuity and becoming, free from all other defilements and**
**impurities (** _ktlesa, sasava dhamma_ **). For him there is no rebirth.**

**The theory of karma should not be confused with so-called 'moral**
**justice' or 'reward and punishment'. The idea of moral justice,**
**or reward and punishment, arises out of the conception of a supreme**
**being, a God, w h o sits in judgment, who is a law-giver and who**
**decides what is right and wrong. The term 'justice' is ambiguous**
**and dangerous, and in its name more harm than good is done to**
**humanity. The theory of karma is the theory of cause and effect,**
**of action and reaction; it is a natural law, which has nothing to**
**do with the idea of justice or reward and punishment. Every**
**volitional action produces its effects or results. If a good action**
**produces good effects and a bad action bad effects, it is not justice,**
**or reward, or punishment meted out by anybody or any power**
**sitting in judgment on your action, but this is in virtue of its own**
**nature, its own law. This is not difficult to understand. But what is**
**difficult is that, according to the karma theory, the effects of a**
**volitional action may continue to manifest themselves even in a life**
**after death. Here we have to explain what death is according to**
**Buddhism.**


**We have seen earlier that a being is nothing but a combination**


32


**IV. The Great Renunciation—Ananda Temple, Burma**


**V. The Buddha—from Mathura, India**


**VI. The Buddha—from China**


**of physical and mental forces or energies. What we call death is the**
**total non-functioning of the physical body. Do all these forces and**
**energies stop altogether with the non-functioning of the body?**
**Buddhism says 'No'. Will, volition, desire, thirst to exist, to**
**continue, to become more and more, is a tremendous force that**
**moves whole lives, whole existences, that even moves the**
**whole world. This is the greatest force, the greatest energy in the**
**world. According to Buddhism, this force does not stop with the**
**non-functioning of the body, which is death; but it continues**
**manifesting itself in another form, producing re-existence which**
**is called rebirth.**

**N o w, another question arises: If there is no permanent, un-**
**changing entity or substance like Self or Soul (** _atman_ **), what is it**
**that can re-exist or be reborn after death? Before we go on to**
**life after death, let us consider what this life is, and how it con-**
**tinues now. What we call life, as we have so often repeated, is**
**the combination of the Five Aggregates, a combination of physical**
**and mental energies. These are constantly changing; they do not**
**remain the same for two consecutive moments. Every moment**
**they are born and they die. 'When the Aggregates arise, decay and**
**die, O bhikkhu, every moment you are born, decay and die.'** **[1 ]**

**Thus, even now during this life time, every moment we are born**
**and die, but we continue. If we can understand that in this life we**
**can continue without a permanent, unchanging substance like**
**Self or Soul, why can't we understand that those forces themselves**
**can continue without a Self or a Soul behind them after the non-**
**functioning of the body ?**

**When this physical body is no more capable of functioning,**
**energies do not die with it, but continue to take some other shape**
**or form, which we call another life. In a child all the physical,**
**mental and intellectual faculties are tender and weak, but they have**
**within them the potentiality of producing a full grown man.**
**Physical and mental energies which constitute the so-called being**
**have within themselves the power to take a new form, and grow**
**gradually and gather force to the full.**


**1**
**Prmj. I (PTS), p. 78.** _'Khandhesujdyamanesujiyamanesu mtyamanesu ca khane khane tvam_
_bbikkhu jayase cajtyase ca miyase ca.'_ **This is quoted in the** _Paramattbajotikd_ **Commentary**
**as the Buddha's own words. So far I have not been able to trace this passage back**
**to its original text.**


33


**As there is no permanent, unchanging substance, nothing passes**
**from one moment to the next. So quite obviously, nothing per-**
**manent or unchanging can pass or transmigrate from one life to**
**the next. It is a series that continues unbroken, but changes every**
**moment. The series is, really speaking, nothing but movement.**
**It is like a flame that burns through the night: it is not the same**
**flame nor is it another. A child grows up to be a man of sixty.**
**Certainly the man of sixty is not the same as the child of sixty**
**years ago, nor is he another person. Similarly, a person who dies**
**here and is reborn elsewhere is neither the same person, nor**
**another** **It is the continuity of the same series.**
_(na ca so na ca anno)._
**The difference between death and birth is only a thought-moment:**
**the last thought-moment in this life conditions the first thought-**
**moment in the so-called next life, which, in fact, is the con-**
**tinuity of the same series. During this life itself, too, one thought-**
**moment conditions the next thought-moment.** **So from the**
**Buddhist point of view, the question of life after death is not a**
**great mystery, and a Buddhist is never worried about this**
**problem.**


**As long as there is this 'thirst' to be and to become, the cycle**
**of continuity (** _samsara_ **) goes on. It can stop only when its driving**
**force, this 'thirst', is cut off through wisdom which sees Reality,**
**Truth, Nirvana.**

CHAPTER IV


**T H E** **T H I R D** **N O B L E** **T R U T H :**


**'The** **Cessation** **of**
_NIRODHA:_ _Dukkha'_


**The Third Noble Truth is that there is emancipation, liberation,**
**freedom from suffering, from the continuity of** **This is**
_dukkha._
**called the Noble Truth of the Cessation of**
_dukkha (Dukkhanirodha-_
**which is** **more popularly known in its**
_ariyasacca),_ _Nibbdna,_
**Sanskrit form of**
_Nirvana._

**T o eliminate** **completely one has to eliminate the main**
_dukkha_
**root of** _dukkha,_ **which is 'thirst' (** _tanha_ **), as we saw earlier. Therefore**
**Nirvana is known also by the term** **'Extinction of**
_Tanhakkhaya_
**Thirst'.**

**N o w you will ask: But what is Nirvana ? Volumes have been**
**written in reply to this quite natural and simple question; they**
**have, more and more, only confused the issue rather than clarified**
**it. The only reasonable reply to give to the question is that it**
**can never be answered completely and satisfactorily in words,**
**because human language is too poor to express the real nature of**
**the Absolute Truth or Ultimate Reality which is Nirvana.**
**Language is created and used by masses of human beings to**
**express things and ideas experienced by their sense organs and**
**their mind. A supramundane experience like that of the Absolute**
**Truth is not of such a category. Therefore there cannot be words**
**to express that experience, just as the fish had no words in his**
**vocabulary to express the nature of the solid land. The tortoise told**
**his friend the fish that he (the tortoise) just returned to the lake after**
**a walk on the land. 'Of course' the fish said, ' Y o u mean swimming.'**
**The tortoise tried to explain that one couldn't swim on the land,**
**that it was solid, and that one walked on it. But the fish insisted**
**that there could be nothing like it, that it must be liquid like his**
**lake, with waves, and that one must be able to dive and swim**
**there.**


35


**Words are symbols representing things and ideas known to us;**
**and these symbols do not and cannot convey the true nature of**
**even ordinary things. Language is considered deceptive and**
**misleading in the matter of understanding of the Truth. So the**
**L** _anhavatara-sutra_ **says that ignorant people get stuck in words**
**like an elephant in the mud.** **[1 ]**

**Nevertheless we cannot do without language. But if Nirvana is**
**to be expressed and explained in positive terms, we are likely im-**
**mediately to grasp an idea associated with those terms, which may**
**be quite the contrary. Therefore it is generally expressed in negative**
**terms** **[2]** **—a less dangerous mode perhaps. So it is often referred to**
**by such negative terms as** _Tatihakkbaya_ **'Extinction of Thirst',**
_Asamkhata_ **'Uncompound', 'Unconditioned',** _Virdga_ **'Absence of**
**desire',** _Nirodha_ **'Cessation',** _Nibbana_ **'Blowing out' or 'Extinction'.**

**Let us consider a few definitions and descriptions of Nirvana as**
**found in the original Pali texts:**

**'It is the complete cessation of that very 'thirst' (** _tanha_ **), giving**
**it up, renouncing it, emancipation from it, detachment from it.'** **[3 ]**

**'Calming of all conditioned things, giving up of all defilements,**
**extinction of "thirst", detachment, cessation, Nibbana.'** **[4 ]**

**' O** **bhikkhus,** **what is** **the** **Absolute (** _Asamkhata,_ **Uncon-**
**ditioned) ? It is, O bhikkhus, the extinction of desire (** _ragakkhayo)_
**the extinction of hatred (** _dosakkhayo_ **), the extinction of illusion**
_(mohakkhayo_ **). This, O bhikkhus, is called the Absolute.'** **[5 ]**



**' O Radha, the extinction of "thirst" (** _Tanhakkhayo_ **) is Nibbana.'** **[6 ]**



**'O bhikkhus, whatever there may be things conditioned or**
**unconditioned, among them detachment (** _virdga_ **) is the highest.**



**1**
**Lanka. p. 113.**

**2**
**Sometimes positive terms like** _Siva_ **'Auspicious', 'Good',** _Khema_ **'Safety',** _Suddhi_
**'Purity',** _Dipa_ **'Island',** _Sarana_ **'Refuge',** _Tana_ **'Protection',** _Para_ **'Opposite shore',**
**'Other side',** _Santi_ **'Peace', 'Tranquillity' are used to denote Nirvana. There are 32**
**synonyms for Nibbana in the** _Asamkhata-samyutta_ **of the** _Samyutta-nikaya._ **They are**
**mostly metaphorical.**

**3**
**Mhvg. (Alutgama, 1922), p. 10; S V p. 421. It is interesting to note that this**
**definition of** _Nirodha_ **'Cessation of** _Dukkha',_ **which is found in the first sermon of**
**the Buddha at Sarnath, does not contain the word** _Nibbana,_ **though the definition**
**means it.**

**That is to say, freedom from conceit, destruction of thirst,** **[1]** **the**
**uprooting of attachment, the** **cutting off of continuity, the**
**extinction of "thirst"** **detachment, cessation, Nibbana.'** **[2 ]**
_(tanha),_

**The reply of Sariputta, the chief disciple of the Buddha, to a**
**direct question 'What is Nibbana?' posed by a Parivrajaka, is**
**identical with the definition of** **given by the Buddha**
_Asamkhata_
**(above): 'The extinction of desire, the extinction of hatred, the**
**extinction of illusion.'** **[3 ]**

**'The abandoning and destruction of desire and craving for**
**these Five Aggregates of Attachment: that is the cessation of**
_dukkha.'_ _[4 ]_

**'The cessation of Continuity and becoming** **is**
_(Bhavanirodha)_
**Nibbana.'** **[5 ]**

**A n d further, referring to Nirvana the Buddha says:**
**'O bhikkhus, there is the unborn, ungrown, and unconditioned.**
**Were there not the unborn, ungrown, and unconditioned, there**
**would be no escape for the born, grown, and conditioned. Since**
**there is the unborn, ungrown, and unconditioned, so there**
**is escape for the born, grown, and conditioned.'** **[6 ]**

**'Here the four elements of solidity, fluidity, heat and motion**
**have no place; the notions of length and breadth, the subtle and**
**the gross, good and evil, name and form are altogether destroyed;**
**neither this world nor the other, nor coming, going or standing,**
**neither death nor birth, nor sense-objects are to be found.'** **[7 ]**

**Because Nirvana is thus expressed in negative terms, there are**
**many who have got a wrong notion that it is negative, and**
**expresses self-annihilation. Nirvana is definitely no annihilation of**
**self, because there is no self to annihilate. If at all, it is the**
**annihilation of the illusion, of the false idea of self.**

**It is incorrect to say that Nirvana is negative or positive. The**
**idtas of 'negative' and 'positive' are relative, and are within the**

**The Pali or Sanskrit word for health is** **a negative term,**
_arogya,_
**which literally means 'absence of illness'. But** **(health) does**
_arogya_
**not represent a negative state. The word 'Immortal' (or its**
**Sanskrit equivalent** **or Pali** **which also is a syno-**
_Amrta_ _Amata),_
**nym for Nirvana, is negative, but it does not denote a negative**
**state. The negation of negative values is not negative. One of the**
**well-known synonyms for Nirvana is** **'Freedom' (Pali**
_Mutti,_
**Skt.** **Nobody would say that freedom is negative. But**
_Mukti)._
**even freedom has a negative side: freedom is always a liberation**
**from something which is obstructive, which is evil, which is**
**negative. But freedom is not negative.** **So Nirvana,** **or**
_Mutti_
**the** **Absolute** **Freedom,** **is** **freedom** **from** **all** **evil,**
_Vimutti,_
**freedom from craving, hatred and ignorance, freedom from all**
**terms of duality, relativity, time and space.**


**We may get some idea of Nirvana as Absolute Truth from the**
**(No.** **140)** **of** **the** **This**
_Dhatuvibhanga-sutta_ _Majjhima-tiikaya._
**extremely important discourse was delivered by the Buddha to**
**Pukkusati (already mentioned), whom the Master found to be**
**intelligent and earnest, in the quiet of the night in a potter's shed.**
**The essence of the relevant portions of the sutta is as follows:**

**A man is composed of six elements: solidity, fluidity, heat,**
**motion, space and consciousness. He analyses them and finds that**
**none of them is 'mine', or 'me'; or 'my self'. He understands how**
**consciousness appears and disappears, how pleasant, unpleasant**
**and neutral sensations appear and disappear. Through this know-**
**ledge his mind becomes detached. Then he finds within him a pure**
**equanimity** **which he can direct towards the attainment of**
_(upekha),_
**any high spiritual state, and he knows that thus this pure equani-**
**mity will last for a long period. But then he thinks:**

**'If I focus this purified and cleansed equanimity on the Sphere**
**of Infinite Space and develop a mind conforming thereto, that is**
**a mental creation** **If I focus this purified and cleansed**
_(samkbatam)._ _[1]_
**equanimity on the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness . . . on the**


**1**
**Notice that all the spiritual and mystic states, however pure and high they may**
**be, are mental creations, mind-made, conditioned and compound (** _samkhata_ **). They**
**are not Reality, not Truth (** _sacca)._


38


**Sphere of Nothingness . . . or on the Sphere of Neither-perception**
**nor Non-perception and develop a mind conforming thereto,**
**that is a mental creation.' Then he neither mentally creates nor**
**wills continuity and becoming (** _bhava_ **) or annihilation** _(vibhava)._ _[1 ]_

**As he does not construct or does not will continuity and becoming**
**or annihilation, he does not cling to anything in the world; as he**
**does not cling, he is not anxious; as he is not anxious, he is**
**completely calmed within (fully blown out within**
_paccattamyeva_
**And he knows: 'Finished is birth, lived is pure**
_parinibbayati)._
**life, what should be done is done, nothing more is left to be done.'** **[2 ]**

**N o w, when he experiences a pleasant, unpleasant or neutral**
**sensation, he knows that it is impermanent, that it does not bind**
**him, that it is not experienced with passion. Whatever may be the**
**sensation, he experiences it without being bound to it (** _yisamyutto)._
**He knows that all those sensations will be pacified with the**
**dissolution of the body, just as the flame of a lamp goes out when**
**oil and wick give out.**

**'Therefore, O bhikkhu, a person so endowed is endowed with**
**the absolute wisdom, for the knowledge of the extinction of all**
**is the absolute noble wisdom.**
_dukkha_

**'This his deliverance, founded on Truth, is unshakable. O**
**bhikkhu, that which is unreality (** _mosadhamma_ **) is false; that which**
**is reality (** _amosadhamma_ **), Nibbana, is Truth (** _Sacca_ **). Therefore, O**
**bhikkhu, a person so endowed is endowed with this Absolute**
**Truth. For, the Absolute Noble Truth (** _paramam ariyasaccam)_ **is**
**Nibbana, which is Reality.'**

**Elsewhere the Buddha unequivocally uses the word Truth in**
**place of Nibbana: 'I will teach you the Truth and the Path**
**leading to the Truth.'** **[3]** **Here Truth definitely means Nirvana.**

**N o w, what is Absolute Truth? According to Buddhism, the**
**Absolute Truth is that there is nothing absolute in the world, that**
**everything is relative, conditioned and impermanent, and that**
**there is no unchanging, everlasting, absolute substance like**
**Self, Soul or** **within or without. This is the Absolute**
_Atman_

**This means that he does not produce new karma, because now he is free from**

**Truth. Truth is never negative, though there is a popular expres-**
**sion as negative truth. The realization of this Truth, i.e., to see**
**things as they are** _{jathdbhiitam_ **) without illusion or ignorance**
_(avijja),_ _[1]_ **is the extinction of craving 'thirst' (** _Tanhakkhaya_ **), and**
**the cessation (** _Nirodha_ **) of** _dukkha,_ **which is Nirvana. It is interest-**
**ing and useful to remember here the Mahayana view of Nirvana**
**as not being different from** _Samsara_ **,** **[2]** **The same thing is Samsara**
**or Nirvana according to the way you look at it—subjectively or**
**objectively. This Mahayana view was probably developed out of**
**the ideas found in the original Theravada Pali texts, to which we**
**have just referred in our brief discussion.**

**It is incorrect to think that Nirvana is the natural result of the**
**extinction of craving. Nirvana is not the result of anything. If it**
**would be a result, then it would be an effect produced by a cause.**
**It would be** **'produced' and 'conditioned'. Nirvana is**
_samkhata_
**neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a**
**result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual,**
**mental state, such as** **or** **T R U T H IS. N I R V A N A IS.**
_dhyana_ _samadhi._
**The only thing you can do is to see it, to realize it. There is a**
**path leading to the realization of Nirvana. But Nirvana is not the**
**result of this path.** **[3]** **Y o u may get to the mountain along a path,**
**but the mountain is not the result, not an effect of the path. Y o u**
**may see a light, but the light is not the result of your eyesight.**

**People often ask: What is there after Nirvana? This question**
**cannot arise, because Nirvana is the Ultimate Truth. If it is**
**Ultimate, there can be nothing after it. If there is anything after**
**Nirvana, then that will be the Ultimate Truth and not Nirvana.**
**A monk named Radha put this question to the Buddha in a**
**different form: 'For what purpose (or end) is Nirvana?' This**
**question presupposes something after Nirvana, when it postulates**
**some purpose** **or end for it.** **So the Buddha answered:** **'O**
**Radha, this question could not catch its limit (i.e., it is beside the**


**1**
**Cf.** _Lanka,_ **p. 200; 'O Mahamati, Nirvana means to see the state of things as they**
**are.'**

**Nagarjuna clearly says that '** _Samsara_ **has no difference whatever from Nirvana**
**and Nirvana has no difference whatever from** _Samsara.'_ **(Madbya. Kari XXV, 19).**

**It is useful to remember here that among nine supra-mundane** _dharmas (navalo-_

**point). One lives the holy life with Nirvana as its final plunge**
**(into the Absolute Truth), as its goal, as its ultimate end.'** **[1 ]**

**Some** **popular** **inaccurately** **phrased** **expressions** **like** **'The**
**Buddha entered into Nirvana or Parinirvana after his death'**
**have given rise to many imaginary speculations about Nirvana.** **[2 ]**

**The moment you hear the phrase that 'the Buddha entered into**
**Nirvana or Parinirvana', you take Nirvana to be a state, or a**
**realm, or a position in which there is some sort of existence, and**
**try to imagine it in terms of the senses of the word 'existence' as**
**it is known to you. This popular expression 'entered into Nirvana'**
**has no equivalent in the original texts. There is no such thing as**
**'entering into Nirvana after death'. There is a word**
_parinibbuto_
**used to denote the death of the Buddha or an Arahant who has**
**realized Nirvana, but it does not mean 'entering into Nirvana'.**
**simply means 'fully passed away', 'fully blown out' or**
_Parinibbuto_
**'fully extinct', because the Buddha or an Arahant has no re-exis-**
**tence after his death.**

**N o w another question arises: What happens to the Buddha or**
**an Arahant after his death,** _parinirvana_ **? This comes under the**
**category of unanswered questions** **Even when the**
_(avjakata)._ _[3]_
**Buddha spoke about this, he indicated that no words in our**
**vocabulary could express what happens to an Arahant after his**
**death. In reply to a Parivrajaka named Vaccha, the Buddha said**
**that terms like 'born' or 'not born' do not apply in the case of an**
**Arahant, because those things—matter, sensation, perception,**
**mental activities, consciousness—with which the terms like 'born'**
**and 'not born' are associated, are completely destroyed and up-**
**rooted, never to rise again after his death.** **[4 ]**

**An Arahant after his death is often compared to a fire gone**
**out when the supply of wood is over, or to the flame of a**
**lamp gone out when the wick and oil are finished.** **[5]** **Here it should**

**S III (PTS), p. 189.**



**2**
**There are some who write 'after the Nirvana of the Buddha' instead of 'after**
**the Parinirvana of the Buddha'. 'After the Nirvana of the Buddha' has no meaning,**
**and the expression is unknown in Buddhist literature. It is always 'after the Pari-**
**nirvana of the Buddha'.**

**be clearly and distinctly understood, without any confusion, that**
**what is compared to a flame or a fire gone out is** _not_ **Nirvana,**
**but the 'being' composed of the Five Aggregates who realized**
**Nirvana. This point has to be emphasized because many people,**
**even some great scholars, have misunderstood and misinterpreted**
**this simile as referring to Nirvana. Nirvana is never compared to a**
**fire or a lamp gone out.**

**There is another popular question: If there is no Self, no**
**who realizes Nirvana? Before we go on to Nirvana, let**
_Atman,_
**us ask the question: W h o thinks now, if there is no Self? We**
**have seen earlier that it is the thought that thinks, that there is no**
**thinker behind the thought. In the same way, it is wisdom**
_(patina_ **), realization, that realizes. There is no other self behind the**
**realization. In the discussion of the origin of** **we saw that**
_dukkha_
**whatever it may be—whether being, or thing, or system—if it is of**
**the nature of arising, it has within itself the nature, the germ, of**
**its cessation, its destruction. N o w** **the cycle of**
_dukkha, samsara,_
**continuity, is of the nature of arising; it must also be of the nature**
**of cessation.** _Dukkha_ **arises because of 'thirst' (** _tanha_ **), and it**
**ceases because of wisdom (** _panha_ **). 'Thirst' and wisdom are both**
**within the Five Aggregates, as we saw earlier.** **[1 ]**

**Thus, the germ of their arising as well as that of their cessation**
**are both within the Five Aggregates. This is the real meaning of**
**the Buddha's well-known statement: 'Within this fathom-long**
**sentient body itself, I postulate the world, the arising of the**
**world, the cessation of the world, and the path leading to the cessa-**
**tion of the world.'** **[2]** **This means that all the Four Noble Truths are**
**found within the Five Aggregates, i.e., within ourselves. (Here the**
**word 'world'** **is used in place of** **This also means**
_(loka)_ _dukkha)._
**that there is no external power that produces the arising and the**
**cessation of**
_dukkha._

**When wisdom is developed and cultivated according to the**
**Fourth Noble Truth (the next to be taken up), it sees the secret of**
**life, the reality of things as they are. When the secret is discovered,**
**when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the**
**continuity of** **in illusion become calm and incapable of**
_samsara_


**1**
**See Aggregate of Formations above pp. 22, 31.**

**2**
**A (Colombo, 1929) p. 218.**


42


producing any more karma-formations, because there is no more
illusion, no more 'thirst' for continuity. It is like a mental disease
which is cured when the cause or the secret of the malady is
discovered and seen by the patient.

In almost all religions the _summum bonum_ can be attained only
after death. But Nirvana can be realized in this very life; it is not
necessary to wait till you die to 'attain' it.

He who has realized the Truth, Nirvana, is the happiest being
in the world. He is free from all 'complexes' and obsessions, the
worries and troubles that torment others. His mental health is
perfect. He does not repent the past, nor does he brood over the

[1]
future. He lives fully in the present. Therefore he appreciates
and enjoys things in the purest sense without self-projections. He
is joyful, exultant, enjoying the pure life, his faculties pleased,

[2]
free from anxiety, serene and peaceful. As he is free from selfish
desire, hatred, ignorance, conceit, pride, and all such 'defilements',
he is pure and gentle, full of universal love, compassion, kindness,
sympathy, understanding and tolerance. His service to others is of
the purest, for he has no thought of self. He gains nothing,
accumulates nothing, not even anything spiritual, because he is
free from the illusion of Self, and the 'thirst' for becoming.

Nirvana is beyond all terms of duality and relativity. It is
therefore beyond our conceptions of good and evil, right and
wrong, existence and non-existence. Even the word 'happiness'
_(sukha_ ) which is used to describe Nirvana has an entirely different
sense here. Sariputta once said: 'O friend, Nirvana is happiness!
Nirvana is happiness!' Then Udayi asked: 'But, friend Sariputta,
what happiness can it be if there is no sensation ?' Sariputta's reply
was highly philosophical and beyond ordinary comprehension:
'That there is no sensation itself is happiness'.

Nirvana is beyond logic and reasoning _(atakkavacara)._ However
much we may engage, often as a vain intellectual pastime, in
highly speculative discussions regarding Nirvana or Ultimate
Truth or Reality, we shall never understand it that way. A child
in the kindergarten should not quarrel about the theory of
relativity. Instead, if he follows his studies patiently and diligently,



**'SI(PTS), P.** **5.**

**2**
**M II (PTS), p. 121.**



43


one day he may understand it. Nirvana is 'to be realized by the
wise within themselves' ( _paccattam veditabbo vinnuhi)._ If we follow
the Path patiently and with diligence, train and purify ourselves
earnestly, and attain the necessary spiritual development, we may
one day realize it within ourselves—without taxing ourselves with
puzzling and high-sounding words.

Let us therefore now turn to the Path which leads to the
realization of Nirvana.

CHAPTER V

T H E F O U R T H N O B L E T R U T H :

_MAGGA:_ 'The Path'


The Fourth Noble Truth is that of the Way leading to the
Cessation of _Dukkha_ _(J)ukkhanirodhagaminlpatipada-ariyasaccd)._
This is known as the 'Middle Path' ( _Majjhima Patipada),_ because it
avoids two extremes: one extreme being the search for happiness
through the pleasures of the senses, which is 'low, common,
unprofitable and the way of the ordinary people'; the other being
the search for happiness through self-mortification in different
forms of asceticism, which is 'painful, unworthy and unprofitable'.
Having himself first tried these two extremes, and having found
them to be useless, the Buddha discovered through personal
experience the Middle Path 'which gives vision and knowledge,
which leads to Calm, Insight, Enlightenment, Nirvana'. This
Middle Path is generally referred to as the Noble Eightfold Path
_(Ariya-Atthangika-Magga),_ because it is composed of eight
categories or divisions: namely,

1. Right Understanding ( _Samma ditthi),_
2. Right Thought ( _Samma sankappa),_
3. Right Speech ( _Samma vaca),_
4. Right Action ( _Samma kammanta),_

5. Right Livelihood ( _Samma ajiva),_
6. Right Effort ( _Samma vayama),_
7. Right Mindfulness _(Samma sati),_
8. Right Concentration _(Samma samadhi)._
Practically the whole teaching of the Buddha, to which he
devoted himself during 45 years, deals in some way or other with
this Path. He explained it in different ways and in different words
to different people, according to the stage of their development
and their capacity to understand and follow him. But the essence


45


of those many thousand discourses scattered in the Buddhist
Scriptures is found in the Noble Eightfold Path.

It should not be thought that the eight categories or divisions
of the Path should be followed and practised one after the other in
the numerical order as given in the usual list above. But they are
to be developed more or less simultaneously, as far as possible
according to the capacity of each individual. They are all linked
together and each helps the cultivation of the others.

These eight factors aim at promoting and perfecting the three
essentials of Buddhist training and discipline: namely: (a)
Ethical Conduct _(Silo), (b)_ Mental Discipline ( _Samadhi_ ) and _(c)_
Wisdom _(Panna)._ _[1]_ It will therefore be more helpful for a coherent
and better understanding of the eight divisions of the Path, if we
group them and explain them according to these three heads.

Ethical Conduct _(Si/a)_ is built on the vast conception of universal love and compassion for all living beings, on which the
Buddha's teaching is based. It is regrettable that many scholars
forget this great ideal of the Buddha's teaching, and indulge in only
dry philosophical and metaphysical divagations when they talk
and write about Buddhism. The Buddha gave his teaching 'for
the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of
compassion for the world' ( _bahujanahitaya bahujanasukhdya lokanu-_
_kampaya)._

According to Buddhism for a man to be perfect there are two
qualities that he should develop equally: compassion _{karuna)_
on one side, and wisdom ( _panna_ ) on the other. Here compassion
represents love, charity, kindness, tolerance and such noble qualities
on the emotional side, or qualities of the heart, while wisdom would
stand for the intellectual side or the qualities of the mind. If one
develops only the emotional neglecting the intellectual, one may
become a good-hearted fool; while to develop only the intellectual side neglecting the emotional may turn one into a hardhearted intellect without feeling for others. Therefore, to be
perfect one has to develop both equally. That is the aim of the
Buddhist way of life: in it wisdom and compassion are inseparably
linked together, as we shall see later.

Now, in Ethical Conduct _(Sila),_ based on love and compassion,


**1**
**MI(PTS), p. 501.**


46


are included three factors of the Noble Eightfold Path: namely,
Right Speech, Right Action and Right Livelihood. (Nos. 3, 4 and
5 in the list).

Right speech means abstention (1) from telling lies, (2) from
backbiting and slander and talk that may bring about hatred,
enmity, disunity and disharmony among individuals or groups of
people, (3) from harsh, rude, impolite, malicious and abusive
language, and (4) from idle, useless and foolish babble and gossip.
When one abstains from these forms of wrong and harmful speech
one naturally has to speak the truth, has to use words that are
friendly and benevolent, pleasant and gentle, meaningful and useful. One should not speak carelessly: speech should be at the
right time and place. If one cannot say something useful, one
should keep 'noble silence'.

Right Action aims at promoting moral, honourable and peaceful conduct. It admonishes us that we should abstain from destroying life, from stealing, from dishonest dealings, from illegitimate
sexual intercourse, and that we should also help others to lead a
peaceful and honourable life in the right way.

Right Livelihood means that one should abstain from making
one's living through a profession that brings harm to others,
such as trading in arms and lethal weapons, intoxicating drinks,
poisons, killing animals, cheating, etc., and should live by a
profession which is honourable, blameless and innocent of harm
to others. One can clearly see here that Buddhism is strongly
opposed to any kind of war, when it lays down that trade in arms
and lethal weapons is an evil and unjust means of livelihood.

These three factors (Right Speech, Right Action and Right
Livelihood) of the Eightfold Path constitute Ethical Conduct.
It should be realized that the Buddhist ethical and moral conduct
aims at promoting a happy and harmonious life both for the
individual and for society. This moral conduct is considered as
the indispensable foundation for all higher spiritual attainments.
No spiritual development is possible without this moral basis.

Next comes Mental Discipline, in which are included three other
factors of the Eightfold Path: namely, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness (or Attentiveness) and Right Concentration. (Nos. 6, 7
and 8 in the list).


47


**Right Effort is the energetic will (i) to prevent evil and un-**
**wholesome states of mind from arising, and (2) to get rid of such**
**evil and unwholesome states that have already arisen within a**
**man, and also (3) to produce, to cause to arise, good and wholesome**
**states of mind not yet arisen, and (4) to develop and bring to**
**perfection the good and wholesome states of mind already**
**present in a man.**

**Right Mindfulness (or Attentiveness) is to be diligently aware,**
**mindful and attentive with regard to (1) the activities of the body**
_**(kaya**_ **), (2) sensations or feelings** _**(vedana),**_ **{3) the activities of the**
**mind (** _**citta**_ **) and (4) ideas, thoughts, conceptions and things**
_**(dhamma).**_

**The practice of concentration on breathing (** _**anapanasati**_ **) is one**
**of the well-known exercises, connected with the body, for mental**
**development. There are several other ways of developing atten-**
**tiveness in relation to the body—as modes of meditation.**

**With regard to sensations and feelings, one should be clearly**
**aware of all forms of feelings and sensations, pleasant, unpleasant**
**and neutral, of how they appear and disappear within oneself.**

**Concerning the activities of mind, one should be aware whether**
**one's mind is lustful or not, given to hatred or not, deluded or**
**not, distracted or concentrated, etc. In this way one should be**
**aware of all movements of mind, how they arise and disappear.**

**As regards ideas, thoughts, conceptions and things, one should**
**know their nature, how they appear and disappear, how they are**
**developed, how they are suppressed, and destroyed, and so on.**

**These four forms of mental culture or meditation are treated in**
**detail in the** **(Setting-up of Mindfulness).** **[1 ]**
_**Satipatthana-sutta**_

**The third and last factor of Mental Discipline is** **Right**
**Concentration leading to the four stages of** **generally**
_**Dhjana,**_
**called trance or** **In the first stage of** **passionate**
_**recueillement.**_ _**Dhjana,**_
**desires and certain unwholesome thoughts like sensuous lust,**
**ill-will, languor, worry, restlessness, and sceptical doubt are**
**discarded, and feelings of joy and happiness are maintained, along**
**with certain mental activities. In the second stage, all intellectual**
**activities are suppressed, tranquillity and 'one-pointedness' of**
**mind developed, and the feelings of joy and happiness are still**


**1**
**See Chapter VII on Meditation.**


48


**VII. The Buddha—from Tibet**


**VIII. The head of the Buddha—from Afghanistan**


**IX. The Buddha—from Cambodia**


**X.** _Samsara-cakra—_ **the Cycle of Existence and Continuity—from Tibet**


**retained. In the third stage, the feeling of joy, which is an active**
**sensation, also disappears, while the disposition of happiness still**
**remains in addition to mindful equanimity. In the fourth stage of**
**all sensations, even of happiness and unhappiness, of joy**
_**Dhjana,**_
**and sorrow, disappear, only pure equanimity and awareness**
**remaining.**

**Thus the mind is trained and disciplined and developed through**
**Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.**

**The remaining two factors, namely Right Thought and Right**
**Understanding go to constitute Wisdom.**

**Right Thought denotes the thoughts of selfless renunciation**
**or detachment, thoughts of love and thoughts of non-violence,**
**which are extended to all beings. It is very interesting and impor-**
**tant to note here that thoughts of selfless detachment, love and**
**non-violence are grouped on the side of wisdom. This clearly**
**shows that true wisdom is endowed with these noble qualities,**
**and that all thoughts of selfish desire, ill-will, hatred and violence**
**are the result of a lack of wisdom—in all spheres of life whether**
**individual, social, or political.**

**Right Understanding is the understanding of things as they are,**
**and it is the Four Noble Truths that explain things as they really**
**are. Right Understanding therefore is ultimately reduced to the**
**understanding of the Four Noble Truths. This understanding is**
**the highest wisdom which sees the Ultimate Reality. According to**
**Buddhism there are two sorts of understanding: What we gener-**
**ally call understanding is knowledge, an accumulated memory, an**
**intellectual grasping of a subject according to certain given data.**
**This is called 'knowing accordingly'** **It is not very**
_**(anubodha).**_
**deep. Real deep understanding is called 'penetration' (** _**pativedha),**_
**seeing a thing in its true nature, without name and label. This**
**penetration is possible only when the mind is free from all impuri-**
**ties and is fully developed through meditation.** **[1 ]**

**From this brief account of the Path, one may see that it is a**
**way of life to be followed, practised and developed by each**
**individual. It is self-discipline in body, word and mind, self-**
**development and self-purification. It has nothing to do with**
**belief, prayer, worship or ceremony. In that sense, it has nothing**


**1vism. (PTS), p. 510.**


49


**which may popularly be called 'religious'. It is a Path leading to the**
**realization of Ultimate Reality, to complete freedom, happiness**
**and peace through moral, spiritual and intellectual perfection.**

**In Buddhist countries there are simple and beautiful customs**
**and ceremonies on religious occasions. They have little to do with**
**the real Path. But they have their value in satisfying certain**
**religious emotions and the needs of those who are less advanced,**
**and helping them gradually along the Path.**

**With regard to the Four Noble Truths we have four functions**
**to perform:**

**The First Noble Truth is** _**Dukkha**_ **, the nature of life, its suffering,**
**its sorrows and joys, its imperfection and unsatisfactoriness, its**
**impermanence and insubstantiality. With regard to this, our**
**function is to understand it as a fact, clearly and completely**
_**(parihnejja).**_

**The Second Noble Truth is the Origin of** **which is**
_**Dukkha,**_
**desire, 'thirst', accompanied by all other passions, defilements and**
**impurities. A mere understanding of this fact is not sufficient.**
**Here our function is to discard it, to eliminate, to destroy and**
**eradicate it (** _**pahatabba).**_

**The Third Noble Truth is the Cessation of** **Nirvana,**
_**Dukkha,**_
**the Absolute Truth, the Ultimate Reality. Here our function is to**
**realize it**
_**(sacchikatabba).**_

**The Fourth Noble Truth is the Path leading to the realization**
**of Nirvana. A mere knowledge of the Path, however complete,**
**will not do. In this case, our function is to follow it and keep to it**
_**(bhavetabba).**_ _**[1 ]**_

_**ANATTA**_


**What in general is suggested by Soul, Self, E g o, or to use the**
**Sanskrit expression** _Atman,_ **is that in man there is a permanent,**
**everlasting and absolute entity, which is the unchanging substance**
**behind the changing phenomenal world. According to somie**
**religions, each individual has such a separate soul which is**
**created by God, and which, finally after death, lives eternally either**
**in hell or heaven, its destiny depending on the judgment of its**
**creator. According to others, it goes through many lives till it is**
**completely purified and becomes finally united with G o d or**
**Brahman, Universal Soul or** _Atman_ **, from which it originally**
**emanated. This soul or self in man is the thinker of thoughts,**
**feeler of sensations, and receiver of rewards and punishments for**
**all its actions good and bad. Such a conception is called the idea**
**of self.**

**Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in**
**denying the existence of such a Soul, Self, or** _Atman._ **According**
**to the teaching of the Buddha, the idea of self is an imaginary, false**
**belief which has no corresponding reality,** **and it produces**
**harmful thoughts of 'me' and 'mine', selfish desire, craving,**
**attachment, hatred, ill-will, conceit, pride, egoism, and other**
**defilements, impurities and problems. It is the source of all the**
**troubles in the world from personal conflicts to wars between**
**nations. In short, to this false view can be traced all the evil in the**
**world.**

**T w o ideas are psychologically deep-rooted in man: self-pro-**
**tection and self-preservation. For self-protection man has created**
**God, on whom he depends for his own protection, safety and**
**security, just as a child depends on its parent. For self-preservation**
**man has conceived the idea of an immortal Soul or** _Atman_ **, which**
**will live eternally. In his ignorance, weakness, fear, and desire,**
**man needs these two things to console himself. Hence he clings**
**to them deeply and fanatically.**


51


**The Buddha's** **teaching does** **not support this** **ignorance,**
**weakness, fear, and desire, but aims at making man enlightened**
**by removing and destroying them, striking at their very root.**
**According to Buddhism, our ideas of G o d and Soul are false and**
**empty. Though highly developed as theories, they are all the**
**same extremely subtle mental projections, garbed in an intricate**
**metaphysical and philosophical phraseology. These ideas are so**
**deep-rooted in man, and so near and dear to him, that he does not**
**wish to hear, nor does he want to understand, any teaching**
**against them.**

**The Buddha knew this quite well. In fact, he said that his**
**teaching was 'against the current' (** _**patisotagami**_ **), against man's**
**selfish desires. Just four weeks after his Enlightenment, seated**
**under a banyan tree, he thought to himself: 'I have realized this**
**Truth which is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand . . .**
**comprehensible only by the wise . . . Men who are overpowered**
**by passions and surrounded by a mass of darkness cannot see this**
**Truth, which is against the current, which is lofty, deep, subtle**
**and hard to comprehend.'**

**With these thoughts in his mind, the Buddha hesitated for a**
**moment, whether it would not be in vain if he tried to explain to**
**the world the Truth he had just realized. Then he compared the**
**world to a lotus pond: In a lotus pond there are some lotuses**
**still under water; there are others which have risen only up to the**
**water level; there are still others which stand above water and**
**are untouched by it. In the same way in this world, there are men**
**at different levels of development. Some would understand the**
**Truth. So the Buddha decided to teach it.** **[1 ]**

**The doctrine of** **or No-Soul is the natural result of, or**
_**Anatta**_
**the corollary to, the analysis of the Five Aggregates and the teach-**
**ing** **of Conditioned** **Genesis**
_**{Paticca-samuppada).**_ _**[2 ]**_

**We have seen earlier, in the discussion of the First Noble Truth**
**that what we call a being or an individual is composed**
_**(Dukkha),**_
**of the Five Aggregates, and that when these are analysed and**
**examined, there is nothing behind them which can be taken as T,**
_Atman,_ **or Self, or any unchanging abiding substance. That is the**
**analytical method. The same result is arrived at through the**

**doctrine of Conditioned Genesis which is the synthetical method,**
**and according to this nothing in the world is absolute. Everything**
**is conditioned, relative, and interdependent. This is the Buddhist**
**theory of relativity.**

**Before we go into the question of** **proper, it is useful to**
_**Anatta**_
**have a brief idea of the Conditioned Genesis. The principle of this**
**doctrine is given in a short formula of four lines:**



**When this is, that is**
_**(Imasmim sati idam hod);**_



**This arising, that arises**
_**(Imassuppada idam uppajjati);**_



**When this is not, that is not (** _**Imasmim asati idam na boti);**_
**This ceasing, that ceases (** _**Imassa nirodha idam nirujjhati).**_ _**[x ]**_



**On** **this** **principle** **of conditionality,** **relativity** **and** **inter-**

**dependence, the whole existence and continuity of life and its**

**cessation are explained in a detailed formula which is called**
**'Conditioned** **Genesis',** **consisting** **of twelve**
_**Paticca-samuppada**_

**factors:**


**1.** **Through ignorance are conditioned volitional actions or**
**karma-formations**
_**(Avijjapaccaya samkhara).**_

**2.** **Through volitional actions is conditioned consciousness**
_**(Samkharapaccaja vinnanam).**_

**3. Through** **consciousness** **are** **conditioned** **mental** **and**
**physical phenomena (** _**Vinnanapaccaja namaruparti).**_

**4.** **Through mental and physical phenomena are conditioned**
**the six faculties (i.e., five physical sense-organs and mind)**
_**(Namarupapaccayd**_ _**salayatanam).**_

**5. Through the six faculties is conditioned (sensorial and**
**mental) contact (** _**Salayatanapaccaya phasso).**_

**6. Through (sensorial and mental) contact is conditioned**
**sensation (** _**Phassapaccaja vedana).**_

**7.** **Through sensation is conditioned desire, 'thirst' (** _**Vedana-**_
_**paccaja tanha).**_
**8. Through desire ('thirst') is conditioned clinging (** _**Tanha-**_
_**paccaja upadanam).**_


**1**
**M III (PTS), p. 63; S II (PTS), pp. 28, 95, etc. To put it into a modern form:**
**When A is, B is;**
**A arising, B arises;**
**When A is not, B is not;**
**A ceasing, B ceases.**


53


**9-** **Through clinging is conditioned the process of becoming**
_**( Upadatiapaccaya bhavo).**_
**10.** **Through the process of becoming is conditioned birth**
_**(Bhavapaccaya**_ _**jati).**_
**1 1 .** **Through birth are conditioned (12) decay, death, lamen-**
**tation, pain, etc.**
_**(Jatipaccaya jaramaranam . . .).**_

**This is how life arises, exists and continues. If we take this**
**formula in its reverse order, we come to the cessation of the**
**process:**

**Through** **the** **complete** **cessation** **of ignorance,** **volitional**
**activities or karma-formations cease; through the cessation of**
**volitional activities, consciousness ceases; . . . through the cessa-**
**tion of birth, decay, death, sorrow, etc., cease.**

**It should be clearly remembered that each of these factors is**
**conditioned (** _**paticcasamuppantia)**_ **as well as conditioning** _**(paticca**_
_**samuppada**_ **).** **[1]** **Therefore they are all relative, interdependent and**
**interconnected, and nothing is absolute or independent; hence**
**no first cause is accepted by Buddhism as we have seen earlier.** **[2 ]**

**Conditioned Genesis should be considered as a circle, and not as a**
**chain.** **[3 ]**

**The question of Free Will has occupied an important place in**
**Western thought and philosophy. But according to Conditioned**
**Genesis, this question does not and cannot arise in Buddhist**
**philosophy. If the whole of existence is relative, conditioned and**
**interdependent, how can will alone be free ? Will, like any other**
**thought, is conditioned. So-called 'freedom' itself is conditioned**
**and relative.** **Such a conditioned and relative 'Free Will' is not**
**denied. There can be nothing absolutely free, physical or mental,**
**as everything is interdependent and relative. It Free Will implies**
**a will independent of conditions, independent of cause and effect,**
**such a thing does not exist. H o w can a will, or anything for that**
**matter, arise without conditions, away from cause and effect,**
**when the whole of existence is conditioned and relative, and is**
**within the law of cause and effect ? Here again, the idea of Free**

**Limited space does not permit a discussion here of this most important**
**doctrine. A critical and comparative study of this subject in detail will be found in a**

**Will is basically connected with the ideas of God, Soul, justice,**
**reward and punishment. N o t only is so-called free will not free,**
**but even the very idea of Free Will is not free from conditions.**

**According to the doctrine of Conditioned Genesis, as well as**
**according to the analysis of being into Five Aggregates, the idea**
**of an abiding, immortal substance in man or outside, whether it**
**is called** _Atman_ **, T, Soul, Self, or E g o, is considered only a false**
**belief, a mental projection. This is the Buddhist doctrine of**
**No-Soul or No-Self.**
_**Anatta,**_

**In order to avoid a confusion it should be mentioned here that**
**there are two kinds of truths: conventional truth (** _**sammuti-sacca,**_
**Skt.** _**samvrti-satja)**_ **and** **ultimate** **truth (** _**paramattha-sacca**_ **,** **Skt.**
_**paramartha-satya)**_ **.** **[1]** **When we use such expressions in our daily**
**life as T, 'you', 'being', 'individual', etc., we do not lie because**
**there is no self or being as such, but we speak a truth conforming**
**to the convention of the world. But the ultimate truth is that there**
**is no T or 'being' in reality. As the** _Mahayana-sutrdlahkdra_ **says:**
**' A person (** _**pudgala**_ **) should be mentioned as existing only in**
**designation (** _**prajnapti**_ **) (i.e., conventionally there is a being),**
**but not in reality (or substance**
_**dravya)'.**_ _**[2 ]**_

**'The negation** **of an imperishable** _Atman_ **is** **the** **common**
**characteristic of all dogmatic systems of the Lesser as well as the**
**Great Vehicle, and, there is, therefore, no reason to assume that**
**Buddhist tradition which is in complete agreement on this point**
**has deviated from the Buddha's original teaching.'** **[3 ]**

**It is therefore curious that recently there should have been a**
**vain attempt by a few scholars** **[4]** **to smuggle the idea of self into the**
**teaching of the Buddha, quite contrary to the spirit of Buddhism.**
**These scholars respect, admire, and venerate the Buddha and his**
**teaching. They look up to Buddhism. But they cannot imagine**
**that the Buddha, whom they consider the most clear and profound**
**thinker, could have denied the existence of an** _Atman_ **or Self**
**which they need so much. They unconsciously seek the support of**
**the Buddha for this need for eternal existence—of course not in a**

**petty individual self with small s, but in the big Self with a capital**
**S.**

**It is better to say frankly that one believes in an** **or Self.**
_**Atman**_
**Or one may even say that the Buddha was totally wrong in deny-**
**ing the existence of an** _Atman._ **But certainly it will not do for any**
**one to try to introduce into Buddhism an idea which the Buddha**
**never accepted, as far as we can see from the extant original texts.**

**Religions which believe in G o d and Soul make no secret of these**
**two ideas; on the contrary, they proclaim them, constantly and**
**repeatedly, in the most eloquent terms. If the Buddha had accepted**
**these two ideas, so important in all religions, he certainly would**
**have declared them publicly, as he had spoken about other things,**
**and would not have left them hidden to be discovered only 25**
**centuries after his death.**

**People become nervous at the idea that through the Buddha's**
**teaching of** _**Anatta**_ **, the self they imagine they have is going to be**
**destroyed. The Buddha was not unaware of this.**

**A bhikkhu once asked him: 'Sir, is there a case where one is**
**tormented when something permanent within oneself is not**
**found?'**

**'Yes, bhikkhu, there is,' answered the Buddha. 'A man has the**
**following view: " T h e universe is that** _Atman,_ **I shall be that**
**after death, permanent, abiding, ever-lasting, unchanging, and I**
**shall exist as such for eternity". He hears the Tathagata or a**
**disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the complete**
**destruction of all speculative views . . . aiming at the extinction of**
**"thirst", aiming at detachment, cessation, Nirvana. Then that**
**man thinks: "I will be annihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be**
**no more." So he mourns, worries himself, laments, weeps, beating**
**his breast, and becomes bewildered. Thus, O bhikkhu, there is a**
**case where one is tormented when something permanent within**
**oneself is not found.'** **[1 ]**

**Elsewhere the Buddha says: 'O bhikkhus, this idea that I may**
**not be, I may not have, is frightening to the uninstructed world-**
**ling.'** **[2 ]**

**Those who want to find a 'Self' in Buddhism argue as follows:**
**It is true that the Buddha analyses being into matter, sensation,**

**perception, mental formations, and consciousness, and says that**
**none of these things is self. But he does not say that there is no**
**self at all in man or anywhere else, apart from these aggregates.**

**This position is untenable for two reasons:**

**One is that, according to the Buddha's teaching, a being is**
**composed only of these Five Aggregates, and nothing more.**
**Nowhere has he said that there was anything more than these**
**Five Aggregates in a being.**

**The second reason is that the Buddha denied categorically, in**
**unequivocal terms, in more than one place, the existence of**
**Soul, Self, or E g o within man or without, or anywhere**
_**Atman,**_
**else in the universe. Let us take some examples.**

**In the** **there are three verses extremely important**
_**Dhammapada**_
**and essential in the Buddha's teaching. They are nos. 5, 6 and 7 of**
**chapter XX (or verses 277, 278, 279).**

**The first two verses say:**

**'All conditioned things are impermanent' (** _**Sabbe SAMKHARA**_
**and** **'All** **conditioned** **things** **are**
_**anicca),**_ _**dukkha' (Sabbe SAM-**_
_**KHARA**_ _**dukkha).**_

**The third verse says:**

**'All** **are without** **self'**
_**dhammas**_ _**(Sabbe DHAMMA anatta).^**_
**Here it should be carefully observed that in the first two verses**
**the word** **'conditioned things' is used. But in its place**
_**samkhara**_
**in the third verse the word** **is used. W h y didn't the**
_**dhamma**_
**third verse use the word** **'conditioned things' as the**
_**samkhara**_
**previous two verses, and why did it use the term** **instead ?**
_**dhamma**_
**Here lies the crux of the whole matter.**

**The term** **denotes the Five Aggregates, all con-**
_**samkhara**_ **[2]**
**ditioned, interdependent, relative things and states, both physical**
**and mental. If the third verse said: 'All** **(conditioned**
_**samkhara**_
**things) are without self', then one might think that, although**
**conditioned things are without self, yet there may be a Self**
**outside conditioned things, outside the Five Aggregates. It is in**



**The first two verses say:**



**The third verse says:**



**1**
**F.L. Woodward's translation of the word** _dhamma_ **here by "AH states compounded'**
**is quite wrong. (The Buddha's** _Path of Virtue_ **, Adyar, Madras, India, 1929, p. 69.)**
**'All states compounded' means only** _samkhara_ **, but not** _dhamma._

_2_
_Samkhara_ **in the list of the Five Aggregates means 'Mental Formations' or 'Mental**
**Activities' producing karmic effects. But here it means all conditioned or com-**
**pounded things, including all the Five Aggregates. The term** _samkhara_ **has different**
**connotations in different contexts.**


57


**order to avoid misunderstanding that the term** **is used in**
_**dhamma**_
**the third verse.**

**The term** _dhamma_ **is much wider than** _samkhara._ **There is no**
**term in Buddhist terminology wider than** _dhamma._ **It includes not**
**only the conditioned things and states, but also the non-condi-**
**tioned, the Absolute, Nirvana. There is nothing in the universe or**
**outside, good or bad, conditioned or non-conditioned, relative**
**or absolute, which is not included in this term. Therefore, it is**
**quite clear that, according to this statement: 'All** _dhammas_ **are**
**without Self', there is no Self, no** _Atman,_ **not only in the Five**
**Aggregates, but nowhere else too outside them or apart from**
**them.** **[1 ]**

**This means, according to the Theravada teaching, that there**
**is no self either in the individual (** _puggala_ **) or in** _dhammas._ **The**
**Mahayana Buddhist philosophy maintains exactly the same posi-**
**tion, without the slightest difference, on this point, putting**
**emphasis on** _dharma-nairatmya_ **as well as on** _pudgala-nairatmya._

**In** **the** **of the** **addressing**
_**Alagaddupama-sutta**_ _**Majjhima-nikaya,**_
**his disciples, the Buddha said:** **'O bhikkhus, accept a soul-**
**theory (** _**Attavada**_ **) in the acceptance of which there would not**
**arise grief, lamentation, suffering, distress and tribulation. But,**
**do you see, O bhikkhus, such a soul-theory in the acceptance of**
**which there would not arise grief, lamentation, suffering, distress**
**and tribulation ?'**

**'Certainly not, Sir.'**

**'Good, O bhikkhus. I, too, O bhikkhus, do not see a soul-**
**theory, in the acceptance of which there would not arise grief,**
**lamentation, suffering, distress and tribulation.'** **[2 ]**

**If there had been any soul-theory which the Buddha had**
**accepted, he would certainly have explained it here, because he**
**asked the bhikkhus to accept that soul-theory which did not**
**produce suffering. But in the Buddha's view, there is no such**
**soul- theory, and any soul-theory, whatever it may be, however**
**subtle and sublime, is false and imaginary, creating all kinds of**
**problems, producing in its train grief, lamentation, suffering,**
**distress, tribulation and trouble.**

_Cf._ **also** _Sabbe samkhara anicca_ **'All conditioned things are impermanent',** _Sabbe_

**Continuing the discourse the Buddha said in the same**
_**sutta-.**_

**'O bhikkhus, when neither self nor anything pertaining to self**
**can truly and really be found, this speculative view:** **" T h e**
**universe is that** _Atman_ **(Soul); I shall be that after death, per-**
**manent, abiding, ever-lasting, unchanging, and I shall exist as**
**such for eternity"—is it not wholly and completely foolish?'** **[1 ]**

**Here the Buddha explicitly states that an** _Atman_ **, or Soul, or**
**Self, is nowhere to be found in reality, and it is foolish to believe**
**that there is such a thing.**

**Those who seek a self in the Buddha's teaching quote a few**
**examples which they first translate wrongly, and then misinterpret.**
**One of them is the well-known line** **from the**
_**Atta hi attano natho**_
**(XII, 4, or verse 160), which is translated as 'Self**
_**Dhammapada**_
**is the lord of self', and then interpreted to mean that the big Self**
**is the lord of the small self.**

**First of all, this translation is incorrect.** **here does not mean**
_**Atta**_
**self in the sense of soul. In Pali the word** **is generally used**
_**atta**_
**as a reflexive or indefinite pronoun, except in a few cases**
**where it specifically and philosophically refers to the soul-theory,**
**as we have seen above. But in general usage, as in the X I I**
**chapter in the** **where this line occurs, and in many**
_**Dhammapada**_
**other places, it is used as a reflexive or indefinite pronoun meaning**
**'myself', 'yourself', 'himself', 'one', 'oneself', etc.** **[2 ]**

**Next, the word** **does not mean 'lord', but 'refuge',**
_**natho**_
**'support', 'help', 'protection'.** **[3]** **Therefore,**
_**Atta hi attano natho**_


_1_
_Ibid.,_ **p. 138. Referring to this passage, S. Radbakrishnan (** _Indian Philosophy,_
**Vol. I, London, 1940, p. 485), says: 'It is the false view that clamours for the**
**perpetual continuance of the small self that Buddha refutes'. We cannot agree with**
**this remark. On the contrary, the Buddha, in fact, refutes here the Universal** _Atman_
**or soul. As we saw just now, in the earlier passage, the Buddha did not accept any**
**self, great or small. In his view, all theories of** _Atman_ **were false, mental projections.**

**2**
**In his article 'Vedanta and Buddhism' (The Middle Way, February, 1957), H.**
**von Glasenapp explains this point clearly.**

**3**
**The commentary on the Dhp. says:** _Natho'ti patittha 'Natho_ **means support,**
**(refuge, help, protection),' (Dhp. A III (PTS), p. 148.) The old Sinhalese** _Sannaya_ **of**
**the Dhp. paraphrases the word** _natho_ **as** _pihifa vanneya_ **'is a support (refuge, help)'.**
_(Dhammapada Purdnasannaya,_ **Colombo, 1926, p. 77). If we take the negative form**
**of** _natho,_ **this meaning becomes further confirmed:** _Anatha_ **does not mean 'without**
**a lord' or 'lordless', but it means 'helpless', 'supportless', 'unprotected', 'poor'.**
**Even the PTS Pali Dictionary explains the word** _natha_ **as 'protector', 'refuge',**
**'help', but not as 'lord'. The translation of the word** _Lokanatha_ **(s.v.) by 'Saviour of**
**the world', just using a popular Christian expression, is not quite correct, because the**
**Buddha is not a saviour. This epithet really means 'Refuge of the World'.**


59


**really means 'One is one's own refuge' or 'One is one's own help'**
**or 'support'. It has nothing to do with any metaphysical soul or**
**self. It simply means that you have to rely on yourself, and not on**
**others.**

**Another example of the attempt to introduce the idea of self into**
**the Buddha's** **teaching is in the well-known words**
_**Attadipa**_
**which are taken out of context**
_**viharatha, attasarana anannasarana,**_
**in the** **This phrase literally means: 'Dwell**
_**Mahaparinibbana-sutta.**_ **[1]**
**making yourselves your island (support), making yourselves your**
**refuge, and not anyone else as your refuge.'** **[2]** **Those who wish to**
**see a self in Buddhism interpret the words** **and**
_**attadipa**_ _**attasarana**_
**'taking self as a lamp', 'taking self as a refuge'.** **[3 ]**

**We cannot understand the full meaning and significance of the**
**advice of the Buddha to Ananda, unless we take into considera-**
**tion the background and the context in which these words were**
**spoken.**

**The Buddha was at the time staying at a village called Beluva.**
**It was just three months before his death,** **A t this time**
_**Parinirvana.**_
**he was eighty years old, and was suffering from a very serious**
**illness, almost dying** **But he thought it was not**
_**(maranantikd).**_
**proper for him to die without breaking it to his disciples who were**
**near and dear to him. So with courage and determination he bore**
**all his pains, got the better of his illness, and recovered. But his**
**health was still poor. After his recovery, he was seated one day in**
**the shade outside his residence. Ananda, the most devoted atten-**
**dant of the Buddha, went to his beloved Master, sat near him, and**
**said: 'Sir, I have looked after the health of the Blessed One, I**
**have looked after him in his illness. But at the sight of the illness**
**of the Blessed One the horizon became dim to me, and my**
**faculties were no longer clear. Yet there was one little consolation:**



**1**
**D II (Colombo, 1929), p. 62.**



**2**
**Rhys Davids (** _Digha-nikaya_ **Translation II, p. 108) 'Be ye lamps unto yourselves.**
**Be ye a refuge to yourselves. Betake yourselves to no external refuge.'**



_3_
_Dipa_ **here does not mean lamp, but it definitely means 'island'. The** _Digha-nikaya_
**Commentary (DA Colombo ed. p. 380), commenting on the word** _dipa_ **here says:**
_Mahasamuddagatam dipam viya attanam dipam patit/ham katvd viharatha._ **'Dwell making**
**yourselves an island, a support (resting place) even as an island in the great ocean.'**
_Samsdra_ **, the continuity of existence, is usually compared to an ocean,** _samsara-_
_sdgara,_ **and what is required in the ocean for safety is an island, a solid land, and not**
**a lamp.**

**I thought that the Blessed One would not pass away until he had**
**left instructions touching the Order of the Sangha.'**

**Then the Buddha, full of compassion and human feeling,**
**gently spoke to his devoted and beloved attendant: 'Ananda,**
**what does the Order of the Sangha expect from me ? I have taught**
**the** **(Truth) without making any distinction as exoteric**
_**Dhamma**_
**and esoteric. With regard to the truth, the Tathagata has nothing**
**like the closed fist of a teacher (** _**dcariya-mutthi**_ **). Surely, Ananda,**
**if there is anyone who thinks that he will lead the Sangha, and**
**that the Sangha should depend on him, let him set down his**
**instructions. But the Tathagata has no such idea. W h y should he**
**then leave instructions concerning the Sangha? I am now old,**
**Ananda, eighty years old. As a worn-out cart has to be kept going**
**by repairs, so, it seems to me, the body of the Tathagata can only**
**be kept going by repairs.**
_**Therefore, Ananda, dwell makingyourselves**_
_**your island (support), making yourselves, not anyone else, your refuge;**_
_**making the Dhamma your island (support), the Dhamma your refuge,**_
_**nothing else your refuge.**_ _**[n ]**_

**What the Buddha wanted to convey to Ananda is quite clear.**
**The latter was sad and depressed. He thought that they would all**
**be lonely, helpless, without a refuge, without a leader after their**
**great Teacher's death. So the Buddha gave him consolation,**
**courage, and confidence, saying that they should depend on them-**
**selves, and on the** **he taught, and not on anyone else, or**
_**Dhamma**_
**on anything else. Here the question of a metaphysical** _Atman,_ **or**
**Self, is quite beside the point.**

**Further, the Buddha explained to Ananda how one could be**
**one's own island or refuge, how one could make the**
_**Dhamma**_
**one's own island or refuge: through the cultivation of mindful-**
**ness or awareness of the body, sensations, mind and mind-objects**
**(the four** _**Satipatthanas**_ **).** **[2]** **There is no talk at all here about an**
_Atman_ **or Self.**

**Another reference, oft-quoted, is used by those who try to**
**find** _Atman_ **in the Buddha's teaching. The Buddha was once**
**seated under a tree in a forest on the way to Uruvela from**
**Benares. On that day, thirty friends all of them young princes,**

**went out on a picnic with their young wives into the same forest.**
**One of the princes who was unmarried brought a prosdtute with**
**him. While the others were amusing themselves, she purloined**
**some objects of value and disappeared. In their search for her in**
**the forest, they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and asked**
**him whether he had seen a woman. He enquired what was the**
**matter. When they explained, the Buddha asked them: 'What do**
**you think, young men ? Which is better for you ? To search after**
**a woman, or to search after yourselves P'** **[1 ]**

**Here again it is a simple and natural question, and there is no**
**justification for introducing far-fetched ideas of a metaphysical**
**or Self into the business. They answered that it was**
_**Atman**_
**better for them to search after themselves. The Buddha then**
**asked them to sit down and explained the** **to them. In**
_**Dhamma**_
**the available account, in the original text of what he preached to**
**them, not a word is mentioned about an**
_**Atman.**_

**Much has been written on the subject of the Buddha's silence**
**when a certain Parivrajaka (Wanderer) named Vacchagotta asked**
**him whether there was an** **or not. The story is as follows:**
_**Atman**_



**Vacchagotta comes to the Buddha and asks:**



**'Venerable Gotama, is there an**
_**Atman ?'**_
**The Buddha is silent.**



**'Then Venerable Gotama, is there no**
_**Atman ?'**_



**Again the Buddha is silent.**
**Vacchagotta gets up and goes away.**



**After the Parivrajaka had left,** **asks the Buddha why he**
###### Ananda
**did not answer Vacchagotta's quesdon. The Buddha explains his**
**position:**

**when asked by Vacchagotta the Wanderer: "Is there**
###### 'Ananda,
**a self?", if I had answered: "There is a self", then,** **that**
###### Ananda,
**would be siding with those recluses and brahmanas who hold the**
**eternalist theory (** _**sassata-vada).**_

**'And,** **when asked by the Wanderer: "Is there no self?"**
###### Ananda,
**if I** h a d **answered: "There is no self", then that would be siding**
**with those recluses and brahmanas who hold the annihilationist**
**theory (** _**uccheda-vada).**_ _**[2 ]**_

**1Mhvg.] (Alutgama, 1929), pp. 21-22.**

**2**
**On another occasion the Buddha had told this same Vacchagotta that the Tatha-**
**gata had no theories, because he had seen the nature of things. (M I (PTS), p. 486.)**
**Here too he does not want to associate himself with any theorists.**



**1Mhvg.] (Alutgama, 1929), pp. 21-22.**



62


**'Again, Ananda, when asked by Vacchagotta: "Is there a**
**self?", if I had answered: "There is a self", would that be in**
**accordance with my knowledge that all** **are without self?'** **[1 ]**
_**dhammas**_

**'Surely not, Sir.'**
**'And again, Ananda, when asked by the Wanderer: "Is there**
**no self?", if I had answered: "There is no self", then that would**
**have been a greater confusion to the already confused Vaccha-**
**gotta.** **[2]** **For he would have thought: Formerly indeed I had an**
**(self), but now I haven't got one.'** **[3 ]**
_**Atman**_

**It should now be quite clear why the Buddha was silent. But it**
**will be still clearer if we take into consideration the whole back-**
**ground, and the way the Buddha treated questions and questioners**
**—which is altogether ignored by those who have discussed this**
**problem.**

**The Buddha was not a computing machine giving answers to**
**whatever questions were put to him by anyone at all, without any**
**consideration. He was a practical teacher, full of compassion and**
**wisdom. He did not answer questions to show his knowledge and**
**intelligence, but to help the questioner on the way to realization.**
**He always spoke to people bearing in mind their standard of**
**development,** **their** **tendencies,** **their** **mental** **make-up,** **their**
**character, their capacity to understand a particular question.** **[4 ]**



_1_
_Sabbe dhamma anatta._ **(Exactly the same words as in the first line of Dhp. XX, 7**
**which we discussed above.) Woodward's translation of these words by 'all things**
**are impermanent' (** _Kindred Sayings_ **IV, p. 282) is completely wrong, probably**
**due to an oversight. But this is a very serious mistake. This, perhaps, is one of the**
**reasons for so much unnecessary talk on the Buddha's silence. The most important**
**word in this context,** _anatta_ **'without a self', has been translated as 'impermanent'.**
**The English translations of Pali texts contain major and minor errors of this kind—**
**some due to carelessness or oversight, some to lack of proficiency in the original**
**language. Whatever the cause may be, it is useful to mention here, with the deference**
**due to those great pioneers in this field, that these errors have been responsible for a**
**number of wrong ideas about Buddhism among people who have no access to the**
**original texts. It is good to know therefore that Miss I. B. Horner, the Secretary of**
**the Pali Text Society, plans to bring out revised and new translations.**



**2**
**In fact on another occasion, evidently earlier, when the Buddha had explained a**
**certain deep and subtle question—the question as to what happened to an Arahant**
**after death—Vacchagotta said: 'Venerable Gotama, here I fall into ignorance, I**
**get into confusion. Whatever little faith I had at the beginning of this conversation**
**with the Venerable Gotama, that too is gone now.' (M I (PTS), p. 487). So the**
**Buddha did not want to confuse him again.**

**According to the Buddha, there are four ways of treating**
**questions: (i) Some should be answered directly;** _**( z )**_ **others**
**should be answered by way of analysing them; (3) yet others**
**should be answered by counter-questions; (4) and lastly, there are**
**questions which should be put aside.** **[1 ]**

**There may be several ways of putting aside a question. One is**
**to say that a particular question is not answered or explained, as**
**the Buddha had told this very same Vacchagotta on more than**
**one occasion, when those famous questions whether the universe**
**is eternal or not, etc., were put to him.** **[2]** **In the same way he had**
**replied to Malunkyaputta and others. But he could not say the**
**same thing with regard to the question whether there is an**
**(Self)** **or not,** **because he had always** **discussed and**
_**Atman**_
**explained it. He could not say 'there is self', because it is contrary**
**to his knowledge that 'all** **are without self'. Then he did**
_**dhammas**_
**not want to say 'there is no self', because that would unnecessarily,**
**without any purpose, have confused and disturbed poor Vaccha-**
**gotta who was already confused on a similar question, as he had**
**himself admitted earlier.** **[3]** **He was not yet in a position to under-**
**stand the idea of** **Therefore, to put aside this quesdon by**
_**Anatta.**_
**silence was the wisest thing in this particular case.**

**We must not forget too that the Buddha had known Vaccha-**
**gotta quite well for a long time. This was not the first occasion on**
**which this inquiring Wanderer had come to see him. The wise and**
**compassionate Teacher gave much thought and showed great**
**consideration for this confused seeker. There are many references**
**in the Pali texts to this same Vacchagotta the Wanderer, his going**
**round quite often to see the Buddha and his disciples and putting**
**the same kind of question again and again, evidently very much**
**worried, almost obsessed by these problems.** **[4]** **The Buddha's**
**silence seems to have had much more effect on Vacchagotta than**
**any eloquent answer or discussion.** **[5 ]**

**XIII. The Buddha—from Borobudur, Java**


**Some people take 'self' to mean what is generally known as**
**'mind' or 'consciousness'. But the Buddha says that it is better for**
**a man to take his physical body as self rather than mind, thought,**
**or consciousness, because the former seems to be more solid than**
**the latter, because mind, thought, or consciousness**
_**{citta, mano,**_
**changes constantly day and night even faster than the**
_**vinnana)**_
**body (kdja).** **[1 ]**

**It is the vague feeling 'I A M ' that creates the idea of self which**
**has no corresponding reality, and to see this truth is to realize**
**Nirvana, which is not very easy. In the** **there is an**
_**Samjutta-nikaya**_ **[2]**
**enlightening conversation on this point between a bhikkhu**
**named Khemaka and a group of bhikkhus.**

**These bhikkhus ask Khemaka whether he sees in the Five**
**Aggregates any self or anything pertaining to a self. Khemaka**
**replies 'No'. Then the bhikkhus say that, if so, he should be an**
**Arahant free from all impurities. But Khemaka confesses that**
**though he does not find in the Five Aggregates a self, or anything**
**pertaining to a self, 'I am not an Arahant free from all impurities.**
**O friends, with regard to the Five Aggregates of Attachment, I**
**have a feeling "I A M ", but I do not clearly see "This is I A M " . '**
**Then Khemaka explains that what he calls 'I A M ' is neither matter,**
**sensation, perception, mental formations, nor consciousness, nor**
**anything without them. But he has the feeling 'I A M ' with regard**
**to the Five Aggregates, though he could not see clearly 'This is I**
**A M ' .** **[8 ]**

**He says it is like the smell of a flower: it is neither the smell of**
**the petals, nor of the colour, nor of the pollen, but the smell of**
**the flower.**



**the Venerable Gotama. It would be good if the Venerable Gotama would preach to**
**me on good and bad (** _kusalakusalam_ **) in brief." The Buddha said that he would explain**
**to him good and bad, in brief as well as in detail; and so he did. Ultimately Vaccha-**
**gotta became a disciple of the Buddha, and following his teaching attained Arahant-**
**ship, realized Truth, Nirvana, and the problems of** _Atman_ **and other questions**
**obsessed him no more. (M I (PTS), pp. 489 ff.)**



**1**
**S II (PTS), p. 94. Some people think that** _Alayavijndna_ **'Store-Consciousness'**
_(Tathagatagarbha)_ **of Mahayana Buddhism is something like a self. But the**
_Lankavatara-siitra_ **categorically says that it is not** _Atman_ **(Lanka, p. 78-79.)**



**2**
**S III (PTS), pp. 126 ff.**



**3**
**This is what most people say about self even today.**



65


**Khemaka further explains that even a person who has attained**
**the early stages of realization still retains this feeling 'I A M ' . But**
**later on, when he progresses further, this feeling of 'I A M ' alto-**
**gether disappears, just as the chemical smell of a freshly washed**
**cloth disappears after a time when it is kept in a box.**

**This discussion was so useful and enlightening to them that**
**at the end of it, the text says, all of them, including Khemaka**
**himself, became Arahants free from all impurities, thus finally**
**getting rid of 'I A M ' .**

**According to the Buddha's teaching, it is as wrong to hold the**
**opinion 'I have no self' (which is the annihilationist theory) as to**
**hold the opinion 'I have self' (which is the eternalist theory),**
**because both are fetters, both arising out of the false idea T A M ' .**
**The correct position with regard to the question of** **is not**
_**Anatta**_
**to take hold of any opinions or views, but to try to see things**
**objectively as they are without mental projections, to see that what**
**we call T, or 'being', is only a combination of physical and mental**
**aggregates, which are working together interdependently in a flux**
**of momentary change within the law of cause and effect, and that**
**there is nothing permanent, everlasting, unchanging and eternal**
**in the whole of existence.**

**Here naturally a question arises: If there is no** **or Self,**
_**Atman**_
**who gets the results of karma (actions) ? No one can answer this**
**question better than the Buddha himself. When this question was**
**raised by a bhikkhu the Buddha said: 'I have taught you, O**
**bhikkhus, to see conditionality everywhere in all things.'** **[1 ]**

**The Buddha's teaching on** **No-Soul, or No-Self, should**
_**Anatta,**_
**not be considered as negative or annihilistic. Like Nirvana, it is**
**Truth, Reality; and Reality cannot be negative. It is the false**
**belief in a non-existing imaginary self that is negative. The teaching**
**on** **dispels the darkness of false beliefs, and produces the**
_**Anatta**_
**light of wisdom. It is not negative: as Asanga very aptly says:**
**'There is the fact of No-selfness' (** _**nairatmyastita).**_ _**[2 ]**_

CHAPTER VII


**• M E D I T A T I O N '** **O R** **M E N T A L** **C U L T U R E :**

_**BHAVANA**_


**The Buddha said: 'O bhikkhus, there are two kinds of illness.**
**What are those two? Physical illness and mental illness. There**
**seem to be people who enjoy freedom from physical illness even**
**for a year or two . . . even for a hundred years or more. But, O**
**bhikkhus, rare in this world are those who enjoy freedom from**
**mental illness even for one moment, except those who are free**
**from mental defilements' (i.e., except arahants).** **[1 ]**

**The Buddha's teaching, particularly his way of 'meditation',**
**aims at producing a state of perfect mental health, equilibrium and**
**tranquility. It is unfortunate that hardly any other section of the**
**Buddha's teaching is so much misunderstood as 'meditation', both**
**by Buddhists and non-Buddhists. The moment the word 'medita-**
**tion' is mentioned, one thinks of an escape from the daily activi-**
**ties of life; assuming a particular posture, like a statue in some cave**
**or cell in a monastery, in some remote place cut off from society;**
**and musing on, or being absorbed in, some kind of mystic or**
**mysterious thought or trance. True Buddhist 'meditation' does not**
**mean this kind of escape at all. The Buddha's teaching on this**
**subject was so wrongly, or so little understood, that in later times**
**the way of 'meditation' deteriorated and degenerated into a kind**
**of ritual or ceremony almost technical in its routine.** **[2 ]**

**Most people are interested in meditation or** _**yoga**_ **in order to gain**
**some spiritual or mystic powers like the 'third eye', which others**
**do not possess. There was some time ago a Buddhist nun in**
**India who was trying to develop a power to see through her ears,**



**1**
**A (Colombo, 1929), p. 276.**



_2_
_Tbe Yogavacara's Manual_ **(edited by T. W. Rhys Davids, London, 1896), a text on**
**meditation written in Ceylon probably about the 18th century, shows how medita-**
**tion at the time had degenerated into a ritual of reciting formulas, burning candles, etc.**
**See also Chapter XII on the Ascetic Ideal,** _History of Buddhism in Ceylon_ **by Walpola**
**Rahula, (Colombo, 1956), pp. 199 ff.**



67


**while she was still in the possession of the 'power' of perfect eye-**
**sight ! This kind of idea is nothing but 'spiritual perversion'. It is**
**always a question of desire, 'thirst' for power.**

**The word meditation is a very poor substitute for the original**
**term** **which** **means** **'culture'** **or** **'development',** **i.e.,**
_**bhavana,**_
**mental culture or mental development. The Buddhist**
_**bhavana,**_
**properly speaking, is mental culture in the full sense of the term.**
**It aims at cleansing the mind of impurities and disturbances, such**
**as lustful desires, hatred, ill-will, indolence, worries and restless-**
**ness, sceptical doubts, and cultivating such qualities as concentra-**
**tion, awareness, intelligence, will, energy, the analytical faculty,**
**confidence, joy, tranquility, leading finally to the attainment of**
**highest wisdom which sees the nature of things as they are, and**
**realizes the Ultimate Truth, Nirvana.**

**There are two forms of meditation. One is the development of**
**mental concentration** **or** **of one-pointedness of**
_**(samatha**_ _**samadhi),**_
**mind (** _**cittekaggata**_ **, Skt.** _**cittaikagrata),**_ **by various methods pre-**
**scribed in the texts, leading up to the highest mystic states such as**
**'the Sphere of Nothingness' or 'the Sphere of Neither-Perception-**
**nor-Non-Perception'. All these mystic states, according to the**
**Buddha,** **are** **mind-created,** **mind-produced,** **conditioned**
**They** **have** **nothing** **to** **do** **with** **Reality,** **Truth,**
_**(samkhata).**_ _**[1]**_
**Nirvana. This form of meditation existed before the Buddha.**
**Hence it is not purely Buddhist, but it is not excluded from the**
**field of Buddhist meditation. However it is not essential for the**
**realization of Nirvana. The Buddha himself, before his Enlighten-**
**ment, studied these yogic practices under different teachers and**
**attained to the highest mystic states; but he was not satisfied**
**with them, because they did not give complete liberation, they**
**did not give insight into the Ultimate Reality. He considered**
**these mystic states only as** **'happy living in this existence'**
_**(ditthadhammasukhavihara**_ **), or 'peaceful living' (** _**santavihara**_ **), and**
**nothing more.** **[2 ]**


**He therefore discovered the other form of 'meditation' known**
**as** **(Skt.** **or** **'Insight' into the nature of**
_**vipassana**_ _**vipasjana**_ _**vidarsana),**_
**things, leading to the complete liberation of mind, to the realiza-**
**tion of the Ultimate Truth, Nirvana. This is essentially Buddhist**

**'meditation', Buddhist mental culture. It is an analytical method**
**based on mindfulness, awareness, vigilance, observation.**

**It is impossible to do justice to such a vast subject in a few**
**pages. However an attempt is made here to give a very brief and**
**rough idea of the true Buddhist 'meditation', mental culture or**
**mental development, in a practical way.**

**The most important discourse ever given by the Buddha on**
**mental development ('meditation') is called the**
_**Satipatthana-sutta**_
**'The Setting-up of Mindfulness' (No. 22 of the** **or N o .**
_**Digha-nikaya,**_
**10 of the** **This discourse is so highly venerated**
_**Majjhima-nikaya).**_
**in tradition that it is regularly recited not only in Buddhist**
**monasteries, but also in Buddhist homes with members of the**
**family sitting round and listening with deep devotion. Very often**
**bhikkhus recite this** **by the bed-side of a dying man to purify**
_**sutta**_
**his last thoughts.**

**The ways of 'meditation' given in this discourse are not cut off**
**from life, nor do they avoid life; on the contrary, they are all**
**connected with our life, our daily activities, our sorrows and joys,**
**our words and thoughts, our moral and intellectual occupations.**

**The discourse is divided into four main sections: the first**
**section deals with our body (** _**kaya**_ **), the second with our feelings**
**and sensations (1** _**vedana**_ **), the third with the mind** _**(citta),**_ **and the**
**fourth with various moral and intellectual subjects**
_**(dhamma).**_

**It should be clearly borne in mind that whatever the form of**
**'meditation' may be, the essential thing is mindfulness or aware-**
**ness** _**(sati),**_ **attention or observation (** _**anupassana).**_

**One of the most well-known, popular and practical examples of**
**'meditation' connected with the body is called 'The Mindfulness or**
**Awareness of in-and-out breathing' (** _**anapanasati**_ **). It is for this 'medi-**
**tation' only that a particular and definite posture is prescribed in**
**the text. For other forms of 'meditation' given in this** _**sutta**_ **, you**
**may sit, stand, walk, or lie down, as you like. But, for cultivating**
**mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, one should sit, according**
**to the text, 'cross-legged, keeping the body erect and mindfulness**
**alert'. But sitting cross-legged is not practical and easy for people**
**of all countries, particularly for Westerners. Therefore, those who**
**find it difficult to sit cross-legged, may sit on a chair, 'keeping the**
**body erect and mindfulness alert'. It is very necessary for this**
**exercise that the meditator should sit erect, but not stiff; his hands**


69


**placed comfortably on his lap. Thus seated, you may close your**
**eyes, or you may gaze at the tip of your nose, as it may be con-**
**venient to you.**

**Y o u breathe in and out all day and night, but you are never**
**mindful of it, you never for a second concentrate your mind on it.**
**N o w you are going to do just this. Breathe in and out as usual,**
**without any effort or strain. N o w, bring your mind to concentrate**
**on your breathing-in and breathing-out; let your mind watch and**
**observe your breathing in and out; let your mind be aware and**
**vigilant of your breathing in and out. When you breathe, you some-**
**times take deep breaths, sometimes not. This does not matter at all.**
**Breathe normally and naturally. The only thing is that when you**
**take deep breaths you should be aware that they are deep breaths,**
**and so on. In other words, your mind should be so fully concentrated**
**on your breathing that you are aware of its movements and**
**changes. Forget all other things, your surroundings, your environ-**
**ment; do not raise your eyes and look at anything. T r y to do this**
**for five or ten minutes.**

**At the beginning you will find it extremely difficult to bring**
**your mind to concentrate on your breathing. Y o u will be aston-**
**ished how your mind runs away. It does not stay. Y o u begin to**
**think of various things. Y o u hear sounds outside. Y o u r mind is**
**disturbed and distracted. Y o u may be dismayed and disappointed.**
**But if you continue to practise this exercise twice daily, morning**
**and evening, for about five or ten minutes at a time, you will**
**gradually, by and by, begin to concentrate your mind on your**
**breathing. After a certain period, you will experience just that**
**split second when your mind is fully concentrated on your breath-**
**ing, when you will not hear even sounds nearby, when no**
**external world exists for you. This slight moment is such a**
**tremendous experience for you, full of joy, happiness and tran-**
**quility, that you would like to continue it. But still you cannot.**
**Y e t if you go on practising this regularly, you may repeat the**
**experience again and again for longer and longer periods. That is**
**the moment when you lose yourself completely in your mindful-**
**ness of breathing. As long as you are conscious of yourself you**
**can never concentrate on anything.**


**This exercise of mindfulness of breathing, which is one of the**
**simplest and easiest practices, is meant to develop concentration**


70


**leading up to very high mystic attainments** **Besides,**
_**{dhyana).**_
**the power of concentration is essential for any kind of deep**
**understanding, penetration, insight into the nature of things,**
**including the realization of Nirvana.**

**Apart from all this, this exercise on breathing gives you**
**immediate results. It is good for your physical health, for relaxa-**
**tion, sound sleep, and for efficiency in your daily work. It makes**
**you calm and tranquil. Even at moments when you are nervous or**
**excited, if you practise this for a couple of minutes, you will see**
**for yourself that you become immediately quiet and at peace. Y o u**
**feel as if you have awakened after a good rest.**

**Another very important, practical, and useful form of 'medita-**
**tion' (mental development) is to be aware and mindful of what-**
**ever you do, physically or verbally, during the daily routine of**
**work in your life, private, public or professional. Whether you**
**walk, stand, sit, lie down, or sleep, whether you stretch or bend**
**your limbs, whether you look around, whether you put on your**
**clothes, whether you talk or keep silence, whether you eat or**
**drink, even whether you answer the calls of nature—in these and**
**other activities, you should be fully aware and mindful of the act**
**you perform at the moment. That is to say, that you should live**
**in the present moment, in the present action. This does not mean**
**that you should not think of the past or the future at all. On the**
**contrary, you think of them in relation to the present moment,**
**the present action, when and where it is relevant.**

**People do not generally live in their actions, in the present**
**moment. They live in the past or in the future. Though they seem**
**to be doing something now, here, they live somewhere else in their**
**thoughts, in their imaginary problems and worries, usually in the**
**memories of the past or in desires and speculations about the**
**future. Therefore they do not live in, nor do they enjoy, what they**
**do at the moment. So they are unhappy and discontented with the**
**present moment, with the work at hand, and naturally they cannot**
**give themselves fully to what they appear to be doing.**

**Sometimes you see a man in a restaurant reading while eating—**
**a very common sight. He gives you the impression of being a very**
**busy man, with no time even for eating. Y o u wonder whether**
**he eats or reads. One may say that he does both. In fact, he does**
**neither, he enjoys neither. He is strained, and disturbed in mind,**


7i


**and he does not enjoy what he does at the moment, does not live**
**his life in the present moment, but unconsciously and foolishly**
**tries to escape from life. (This does not mean, however, that one**
**should not talk with a friend while having lunch or dinner.)**

**Y o u cannot escape life however you may try. As long as you**
**live, whether in a town or in a cave, you have to face it and live it.**
**Real life is the present moment—not the memories of the past**
**which is dead and gone, nor the dreams of the future which is not**
**yet born. One who lives in the present moment lives the real life,**
**and he is happiest.**

**When asked why his disciples, who lived a simple and quiet**
**life with only one meal a day, were so radiant, the Buddha**
**replied: 'They do not repent the past, nor do they brood over the**
**future. They live in the present. Therefore they are radiant. By**
**brooding over the future and repenting the past, fools dry up**
**like green reeds cut down (in the sun).'** **[1 ]**

**Mindfulness, or awareness, does not mean that you should**
**think and be conscious 'I am doing this' or 'I am doing that'. N o .**
**Just the contrary. The moment you think 'I am doing this', you**
**become self-conscious, and then you do not live in the action, but**
**you live in the idea 'I am', and consequently your work too is**
**spoilt. Y o u should forget yourself completely, and lose yourself in**
**what you do. The moment a speaker becomes self-conscious and**
**thinks 'I am addressing an audience', his speech is disturbed and**
**his trend of thought broken. But when he forgets himself in his**
**speech, in his subject, then he is at his best, he speaks well and**
**explains things clearly. All great work—artistic, poetic, intellec-**
**tual or spiritual—is produced at those moments when its creators**
**are lost completely in their actions, when they forget themselves**
**altogether, and are free from self-consciousness.**

**This mindfulness or awareness with regard to our activities,**
**taught by the Buddha, is to live in the present moment, to live in**
**the present action. (This is also the Zen way which is based pri-**
**marily on this teaching.) Here in this form of meditation, you**
**haven't got to perform any particular action in order to develop**
**mindfulness, but you have only to be mindful and aware of**
**whatever you may do. Y o u haven't got to spend one second of**


7 [2 ]


**your precious time on this particular 'meditation': you have**
**only to cultivate mindfulness and awareness always, day and night,**
**with regard to all activities in your usual daily life. These two**
**forms of'meditation' discussed above are connected with our body.**

**Then there is a way of practising mental development ('medita-**
**tion') with regard to all our sensations or feelings, whether happy,**
**unhappy or neutral. Let us take only one example. Y o u experience**
**an unhappy, sorrowful sensation. In this state your mind is**
**cloudy, hazy, not clear, it is depressed. In some cases, you do not**
**even see clearly why you have that unhappy feeling. First of all,**
**you should learn not to be unhappy about your unhappy feeling,**
**not to be worried about your worries. But try to see clearly why**
**there is a sensation or a feeling of unhappiness, or worry, or sorrow.**
**T r y to examine how it arises, its cause, how it disappears, its**
**cessation. Try to examine it as if you are observing it from outside,**
**without any subjective reaction, as a scientist observes some**
**object. Here, too, you should not look at it as 'my feeling' or 'my**
**sensation' subjectively, but only look at it as 'a feeling' or 'a**
**sensation' objectively. Y o u should forget again the false idea of**
**T. When you see its nature, how it arises and disappears, your**
**mind grows dispassionate towards that sensation, and becomes**
**detached and free. It is the same with regard to all sensations or**
**feelings.**


**N o w let us discuss the form of 'meditation' with regard to our**
**minds. Y o u should be fully aware of the fact whenever your mind**
**is passionate or detached, whenever it is overpowered by hatred,**
**ill-will, jealousy, or is full of love, compassion, whenever it is**
**deluded or has a clear and right understanding, and so on and so**
**forth. We must admit that very often we are afraid or ashamed to**
**look at our own minds. So we prefer to avoid it. One should be**
**bold and sincere and look at one's own mind as one looks at**
**one's face in a mirror.** **[1 ]**

**Here is no attitude of criticizing or judging, or discriminating**
**between right and wrong, or good and bad. It is simply observing,**
**watching, examining. Y o u are not a judge, but a scientist. When**
**you observe your mind, and see its true nature clearly, you become**
**dispassionate with regard to its emotions, sentiments and states.**


**1M I (PTS), p. 1oo.**


73


**Thus you become detached and free, so that you may see things as**
**they are.**

**Let us take one example. Say you are really angry, overpowered**
**by anger, ill-will, hatred. It is curious, and paradoxical, that the**
**man who is in anger is not really aware, not mindful that he is**
**angry. The moment he becomes aware and mindful of that state of**
**his mind, the moment he sees his anger, it becomes, as if it were,**
**shy and ashamed, and begins to subside. Y o u should examine its**
**nature, how it arises, how it disappears. Here again it should be**
**remembered that you should not think 'I am angry', or of 'my**
**anger'. Y o u should only be aware and mindful of the state of an**
**angry mind. Y o u are only observing and examining an angry**
**mind objectively. This should be the attitude with regard to all**
**sentiments, emotions, and states of mind.**

**Then there is a form of 'meditation' on ethical, spiritual and**
**intellectual subjects. All our studies, reading, discussions, conver-**
**sation and deliberations on such subjects are included in this**
**'meditation'. To read this book, and to think deeply about the**
**subjects discussed in it, is a form of meditation. We have seen**
**earlier** **[1]** **that the conversation between Khemaka and the group**
**of monks was a form of meditation which led to the realization of**
**Nirvana.**

**So, according to this form of meditation, you may study, think,**
**and deliberate on the Five Hindrances (** _**Nivarana**_ **), namely:**



**1.** **lustful desires (** _**kamacchanda),**_



**2.** **ill-will, hatred or anger (** _**vjapada),**_



**3.** **torpor and languor (** _**thina-middha),**_
**4.** **restlessness and worry (** _**uddhacca-kukkucca),**_



**5.** **sceptical doubts (** _**vicikiccha).**_



**These five are considered as hindrances to any kind of clear**
**understanding, as a matter of fact, to any kind of progress. When**
**one is over-powered by them and when one does not know how to**
**get rid of them, then one cannot understand right and wrong, or**
**good and bad.**

**One may also 'meditate' on the Seven Factors of Enlightenment**
**They are:**
_**(Bojjhanga).**_


**1**
**See above p. 65.**

74


**1.** **Mindfulness (** _**sati**_ **), i.e., to be aware and mindful in all**
**activities and movements both physical and mental, as we**
**discussed above.**

**2. Investigation and research into the various problems of**
**doctrine** _**(dhamma-vicayd).**_ **Included** **here** **are** **all** **our**
**religious,** **ethical** **and** **philosophical** **studies,** **reading,**
**researches,** **discussions,** **conversation,** **even** **attending**
**lectures relating to such doctrinal subjects.**

**3. Energy (** _**viriya**_ **), to work with determination till the end.**
###### 4. Joy ( piti ), the quality quite contrary to the pessimistic, gloomy or melancholic attitude of mind.



**5. Relaxation (** _**passaddhi**_ **) Of both body and mind. One should**
**not be stiff physically or mentally.**



**6.** **Concentration (** _**samadhi**_ **), as discussed above.**
**7. Equanimity (** _**upekkha**_ **), i.e., to be able to face life in all its**
**vicissitudes** **with** **calm of mind, tranquillity,** **without**
**disturbance.**



**To cultivate these qualities the most essential thing is a genuine**
**wish, will, or inclination. Many other material and spiritual con-**
**ditions conducive to the development of each quality are** **des-**
**cribed in the texts.**

**One may also 'meditate' on such subjects as the Five Aggre-**
**gates investigating the question 'What is a being ?' or 'What is it**
**that is called 1 ?', or on the Four Noble Truths, as we discussed**
**above. Study and investigation of those subjects constitute this**
**fourth form of meditation, which leads to the realization of**
**Ultimate Truth.**

**Apart from those we have discussed here, there are many other**
**subjects of meditation, traditionally forty in number, among which**
**mention should be made particularly of the four Sublime States:**
**(B** _**rahma-vihara):**_ **(1)** **extending unlimited,** **universal** **love and**
**good-will (** _**metta**_ **) to all living beings without any kind of discri-**
**mination, 'just as a mother loves her only child'; (2) compassion**
_**(\karuna**_ **) for all living beings who are suffering, in trouble and**
**affliction; (3) sympathetic joy (** _**muditd**_ **) in others' success, welfare**
**and happiness; and (4) equanimity** _**(upekkha)**_ **in all vicissitudes of**
**life.**

CHAPTER VIII


**W H A T** **T H E** **B U D D H A** **T A U G H T** **A N D**


**T H E** **W O R L D** **T O D A Y**


**There are some who believe that Buddhism is so lofty and sublime**
**a system that it cannot be practised by ordinary men and women in**
**this workaday world of ours, and that one has to retire from it to a**
**monastery, or to some quiet place, if one desires to be a true**
**Buddhist.**

**This is a sad misconception, due evidently to a lack of under-**
**standing of the teaching of the Buddha. People run to such hasty**
**and wrong conclusions as a result of their hearing, or reading**
**casually, something about Buddhism written by someone, who,**
**as he has not understood the subject in all its aspects, gives only**
**a partial and lopsided view of it. The Buddha's teaching is meant**
**not only for monks in monasteries, but also for ordinary men and**
**women living at home with their families. The Noble Eightfold**
**Path, which is the Buddhist way of life, is meant for all, without**
**distinction of any kind.**

**The vast majority of people in the world cannot turn monk,**
**or retire into caves or forests. However noble and pure Buddhism**
**may be, it would be useless to the masses of mankind if they could**
**not follow it in their daily life in the world of today. But if you**
**understand the spirit of Buddhism correctly (and not only its**
**letter), you can surely follow and practise it while living the life**
**of an ordinary man.**

**There may be some who find it easier and more convenient to**
**accept Buddhism, if they do live in a remote place, cut off from the**
**society of others. Others may find that that kind of retirement**
**dulls and depresses their whole being both physically and mentally,**
**and that it may not therefore be conducive to the development of**
**their spiritual and intellectual life.**

**True renunciation does not mean running away physically**
**from the world. Sariputta, the chief disciple of the Buddha, said**


76


**that one man might live in a forest devoting himself to ascetic**
**practices, but might be full of impure thoughts and 'defilements';**
**another might live in a village or a town, practising no ascetic**
**discipline, but his mind might be pure, and free from 'defilements'.**
**Of these two, said Sariputta, the one who lives a pure life in the**
**village or town is definitely far superior to, and greater than, the**
**one who lives in the forest.** **[1 ]**

**The common belief that to follow the Buddha's teaching one**
**has to retire from life is a misconception. It is really an uncon-**
**scious defence against practising it. There are numerous references**
**in Buddhist literature to men and women living ordinary, normal**
**family fives who successfully practised what the Buddha taught,**
**and realized Nirvana. Vacchagotta the Wanderer, (whom we met**
**earlier in the chapter on** _Anatta),_ **once asked the Buddha straight-**
**forwardly whether there were laymen and women leading the**
**family life, who followed his teaching successfully and attained**
**to high spiritual states. The Buddha categorically stated that there**
**were not one or two, not a hundred or two hundred or five hun-**
**dred, but many more laymen and women leading the family life**
**who followed his teaching successfully and attained to high**
**spiritual states.** **[2 ]**

**It may be agreeable for certain people to live a retired life in a**
**quiet place away from noise and disturbance. But it is certainly**
**more praiseworthy and courageous to practise Buddhism living**
**among your fellow beings, helping them and being of service to**
**them. It may perhaps be useful in some cases for a man to live in**
**retirement for a time in order to improve his mind and character,**
**as preliminary moral, spiritual and intellectual training, to be**
**strong enough to come out later and help others. But if a man**
**lives all his life in solitude, thinking only of his own happiness and**
**'salvation', without caring for his fellows, this surely is not in**
**keeping with the Buddha's teaching which is based on love,**
**compassion, and service to others.**

**One might now ask: If a man can follow Buddhism while**
**living the life of an ordinary layman, why was the Sangha, the**
**Order of monks, established by the Buddha ? The Order provides**
**opportunity for those who are willing to devote their lives not**


**1M**
_2Ibid.,_ **pp. 490 ff.**


77


**only to their own spiritual and intellectual development, but also**
**to the service of others. An ordinary layman with a family cannot**
**be expected to devote his whole life to the service of others,**
**whereas a monk, who has no family responsibilities or any other**
**worldly ties, is in a position to devote his whole life 'for the good of**
**the many, for the happiness of the many' according to the Buddha's**
**advice. That is how in the course of history, the Buddhist**
**monastery became not only a spiritual centre, but also a centre of**
**learning and culture.**

**The** **(No. 31 of the** **shows with what**
_**Sigala-sutta**_ _**Digha-nikaya)**_
**great respect the layman's life, his family and social relations are**
**regarded by the Buddha.**

**A young man named Sigala used to worship the six cardinal**
**points of the heavens—east, south, west, north, nadir and zenith—**
**in obeying and observing the last advice given him by his dying**
**father. The Buddha told the young man that in the 'noble**
**discipline' (** _**ariyassa vinaye**_ **) of his teaching the six directions were**
**different. According to his 'noble discipline' the six directions**
**were: east: parents; south: teachers; west: wife and children;**
**north: friends, relatives and neighbours; nadir: servants, workers**
**and employees; zenith: religious men.**

**'One should worship these six directions' said the Buddha. Here**
**the word 'worship'** **is very significant, for one**
_**(namasseyya)**_
**worships something sacred, something worthy of honour and**
**respect. These six family and social groups mentioned above are**
**treated in Buddhism as sacred, worthy of respect and worship.**
**But how is one to 'worship' them? The Buddha says that one**
**could 'worship' them only by performing one's duties towards**
**them. These duties are explained in his discourse to Sigala.**

**First: Parents are sacred to their children. The Buddha says:**
**'Parents are called Brahma'** **The term**
_**(Brahmati matapitaro).**_ _**Brahma**_
**denotes the highest and most sacred conception in Indian thought,**
**and in it the Buddha includes parents. So in good Buddhist**
**families at the present time children literally 'worship' their**
**parents every day, morning and evening. They have to perform**
**certain duties towards their parents according to the 'noble**
**discipline': they should look after their parents in their old age;**
**should do whatever they have to do on their behalf; should maintain**
**the honour of the family and continue the family tradition;**


78


**should protect the wealth earned by their parents; and perform**
**their funeral rites after their death. Parents, in their turn, have**
**certain responsibilities towards their children: they should keep**
**their children away from evil courses; should engage them in good**
**and profitable activities; should give them a good education;**
**should marry them into good families; and should hand over the**
**property to them in due course.**

**Second: The relation between teacher and pupil: a pupil should**
**respect and be obedient to his teacher; should attend to his**
**needs if any; should study earnestly. A n d the teacher, in his**
**turn, should train and shape his pupil properly; should teach him**
**well; should introduce him to his friends; and should try to**
**procure him security or employment when his education is over.**

**Third: The relation between husband and wife: love between**
**husband and wife is considered almost religious or sacred. It is**
**called** **'sacred family life'.** **Here, too, the**
_**sadara-Brahmacariya**_
**significance of the term** **should be noted: the highest**
_**Brahma**_
**respect is given to this relationship. Wives and husbands should be**
**faithful, respectful and devoted to each other, and they have**
**certain duties towards each other: the husband should always**
**honour his wife and never be wanting in respect to her; he should**
**love her and be faithful to her; should secure her position and**
**comfort; and should please her by presenting her with clothing**
**and jewellery. (The fact that the Buddha did not forget to mention**
**even such a thing as the gifts a husband should make to his wife**
**shows how understanding and sympathetic were his humane**
**feelings towards ordinary human emotions.) The wife, in her**
**turn, should supervise and look after household affairs; should**
**entertain** **guests,** **visitors,** **friends,** **relatives** **and** **employees;**
**should love and be faithful to her husband; should protect his**
**earnings; should be clever and energetic in all activities.**

**Fourth: The relation between friends, relatives and neighbours:**
**they should be hospitable and charitable to one another; should**
**speak pleasantly and agreeably; should work for each other's**
**welfare; should be on equal terms with one another; should not**
**quarrel among themselves; should help each other in need;**
**and should not forsake each other in difficulty.**

**Fifth: The relation between master and servant: the master or**
**the employer has several obligations towards his servant or his**


79


**employee: work should be assigned according to ability and**
**capacity; adequate wages should be paid; medical needs should**
**be provided; occasional donations or bonuses should be granted.**
**The servant or employee, in his turn, should be diligent and not**
**lazy; honest and obedient and not cheat his master; he should be**
**earnest in his work.**

**Sixth: The relation between the religious (lit. recluses and**
**brahmanas) and the laity: lay people should look after the**
**material needs of the religious with love and respect; the religious**
**with a loving heart should impart knowledge and learning to the**
**laity, and lead them along the good path away from evil.**

**We see then that the lay life, with its family and social relations,**
**is included in the 'noble discipline', and is within the framework**
**of the Buddhist way of life, as the Buddha envisaged it.**

**So in the** **one of the oldest Pali texts, Sakka,**
_**Samyutta-nikaya,**_
**the king of the gods (** _**devas**_ **), declares that he worships not only the**
**monks who live a virtuous holy life, but also 'lay disciples (** _**upasaka)**_
**who perform meritorious deeds, who are virtuous, and maintain**
**their families righteously'.** **[1 ]**

**If one desires to become a Buddhist, there is no initiation**
**ceremony (or baptism) which one has to undergo. (But to become**
**a** **a member of the Order of the** **one has to undergo**
_**bhikkbu,**_ _**Sangha,**_
**a long process of disciplinary training and education.) If one**
**understands the Buddha's teaching, and if one is convinced that**
**his teaching is the right Path and if one tries to follow it, then**
**one is a Buddhist. But according to the unbroken age-old**
**tradition in Buddhist countries, one is considered a Buddhist if**
**one takes the Buddha, the** **(the Teaching) and the**
_**Dhamma**_ _**Sangha**_
**(the Order of Monks)—generally called 'the Triple-Gem'—as**
**one's refuges, and undertakes to observe the Five Precepts**
_**(Panea-si la)**_ **—the minimum moral obligations of a lay Buddhist—**
**(i) not to destroy life, (2) not to steal, (3) not to commit adultery,**
**(4) not to tell lies, (5) not to take intoxicating drinks—reciting**
**the formulas given in the ancient texts. On religious occasions**
**Buddhists in congregation usually recite these formulas, following**
**the lead of a Buddhist monk.**


**There are no external rites or ceremonies which a Buddhist has**


**1**
**S**

**XV. The Buddha—from Sarnath, India**


XVI. The Buddha—from Borobudur, Java


**to perform. Buddhism is a way of life, and what is essential is**
**following the Noble Eightfold Path. Of course there are in all**
**Buddhist countries simple and beautiful ceremonies on religious**
**occasions. There are shrines with statues of the Buddha,**
_**stupas**_
**or** **and Bo-trees in monasteries where Buddhists worship,**
_**ddgabas**_
**offer flowers, light lamps and burn incense. This should not be**
**likened to prayer in theistic religions; it is only a way of paying**
**homage to the memory of the Master who showed the way.**
**These traditional observances, though inessential, have their**
**value in satisfying the religious emotions and needs of those who**
**are less advanced intellectually and spiritually, and helping them**
**gradually along the Path.**

**Those who think that Buddhism is interested only in lofty**
**ideals, high moral and philosophical thought, and that it ignores**
**the social and economic welfare of people, are wrong. The Buddha**
**was interested in the happiness of men. To him happiness was not**
**possible without leading a pure life based on moral and spiritual**
**principles. But he knew that leading such a life was hard in**
**unfavourable material and social conditions.**

**Buddhism does not consider material welfare as an end in**
**itself: it is only a means to an end—a higher and nobler end. But**
**it is a means which is indispensable, indispensable in achieving**
**a higher purpose for man's happiness. So Buddhism recognizes the**
**need of certain minimum material conditions favourable to**
**spiritual success—even that of a monk engaged in meditation in**
**some solitary place.** **[1 ]**

**The Buddha did not take life out of the context of its social and**
**economic background; he looked at it as a whole, in all its social,**
**economic and political aspects. His teachings on ethical, spiritual**
**and philosophical problems are fairly well known. But little is**
**known, particularly in the West, about his teaching on social,**
**economic and political matters. Yet there are numerous discourses**
**dealing with these scattered throughout the ancient Buddhist**
**texts. Let us take only a few examples.**

**The** **of the** **(No.** **26) clearly**
_**Cakkavattisihanada-sutta**_ _**Digha-nikdya**_
**states that poverty (** _**daliddiya**_ **) is the cause of immorality and crimes**


**1**
**MA I (PTS), p. 290 f. (Buddhist monks, members of the order of the** _Sangha_ **, are**
**not expected to have personal property, but they are allowed to hold communal**
_Sanghika_ **) property).**


8l


**such as theft, falsehood, violence, hatred, cruelty, etc. Kings in**
**ancient times, like governments today, tried to suppress crime**
**through** **punishment.** **The** **of the** **same**
_**Kutadanta-sutta**_ _**Nikaja**_
**explains how futile this is. It says that this method can never be**
**successful. Instead the Buddha suggests that, in order to eradicate**
**crime, the economic condition of the people should be improved:**
**grain and other facilities for agriculture should be provided for**
**farmers and cultivators; capital should be provided for traders**
**and those engaged in business; adequate wages should be paid to**
**those who are employed. When people are thus provided for with**
**opportunities for earning a sufficient income, they will be con-**
**tented, will have no fear or anxiety, and consequently the country**
**will be peaceful and free from crime.** **[1 ]**

**Because of this, the Buddha told lay people how important it is**
**to improve their economic condition. This does not mean that**
**he approved of hoarding wealth with desire and attachment, which**
**is against his fundamental teaching, nor did he approve of each**
**and every way of earning one's livelihood. There are certain trades**
**like the production and sale of armaments, which he condemns**
**as evil means of livelihood, as we saw earlier.** **[2 ]**

**A man named Dighajanu once visited the Buddha and said:**
**'Venerable Sir, we are ordinary lay men, leading the family life**
**with wife and children. Would the Blessed One teach us some**
**doctrines which will be conducive to our happiness in this world**
**and hereafter.'**

**The Buddha tells him that there are four things which are**
**conducive to a man's happiness in this world: First: he should**
**be skilled, efficient, earnest, and energetic in whatever profession**
**he is engaged, and he should know it well (** _**uttbana-sampada);**_
**second: he should protect his income, which he has thus earned**
**righteously, with the sweat of his brow (** _**arakkba-sampadd**_ **); (This**
**refers to protecting wealth from thieves, etc. All these ideas should**
**be considered against the background of the period.) third: he**
**should** **have** **good** **friends** **who** **are** **faithful,**
_**(kalyana-mitta)**_
**learned, virtuous, liberal and intelligent, who will help him along**
**the right path away from evil; fourth: he should spend reason-**
**ably, in proportion to his income, neither too much nor too little,**


**2**
**See above p. 47.**


82


**i.e., he should not hoard wealth avariciously, nor should he be**
**extravagant—in other words he should live within his means**
_**(samajivikata).**_

**Then the Buddha expounds the four virtues conducive to a**
**layman's happiness hereafter: (i)** _**Saddha**_ **: he should have faith**
**and confidence in moral, spiritual and intellectual values; (2)**
_**S i / a :**_ **he should abstain from destroying and harming life, from**
**stealing and cheating, from adultery, from falsehood, and from**
**intoxicating** **drinks;** **(3)** _**Caga**_ **:** **he** **should** **practise** **charity,**
**generosity, without attachment and craving for his wealth; (4)**
_**Patina**_ **: he should develop wisdom which leads to the complete**
**destruction of suffering, to the realization of Nirvana.** **[1 ]**

**Sometimes the Buddha even went into details about saving**
**money and spending it, as, for instance, when he told the young**
**man Sigala that he should spend one fourth of his income on his**
**daily expenses, invest half in his business and put aside one fourth**
**for any emergency.** **[2 ]**

**Once the Buddha told Anathapindika, the great banker, one of**
**his most devoted lay disciples who founded for him the celebrated**
**Jetavana monastery at Savatthi, that a layman, who leads an**
**ordinary family life, has four kinds of happiness. The first**
**happiness is to enjoy economic security or sufficient wealth**
**acquired by just and righteous means** _**(attki-sukha)**_ **; the second is**
**spending that wealth liberally on himself, his family, his friends**
**and relatives, and on meritorious deeds (** _**bhoga-sukha**_ **); the third to**
**be free from debts (** _**anana-sukha**_ **); the fourth happiness is to live a**
**faultless, and a pure life without committing evil in thought, word**
**or deed (** _**anavajja-sukha**_ **). It must be noted here that three of these**
**kinds are economic, and that the Buddha finally reminded the**
**banker that economic and material happiness is 'not worth one**
**sixteenth part' of the spiritual happiness arising out of a faultless**
**and good life.** **[3 ]**

**From the few examples given above, one could see that the**
**Buddha considered economic welfare as requisite for human**
**happiness, but that he did not recognize progress as real and true**

83


**if it was only material, devoid of a spiritual and moral foundation.**
**While encouraging material progress, Buddhism always lays**
**great stress on the development of the moral and spiritual**
**character for a happy, peaceful and contented society.**

**The Buddha was just as clear on politics, on war and peace.**
**It is too well known to be repeated here that Buddhism advocates**
**and preaches non-violence and peace as its universal message, and**
**does not approve of any kind of violence or destruction of life.**
**According to Buddhism there is nothing that can be called a**
**'just war'—which is only a false term coined and put into circula-**
**tion to justify and excuse hatred, cruelty, violence and massacre.**
**W h o decides what is just or unjust ? The mighty and the victorious**
**are 'just', and the weak and the defeated are 'unjust'. Our war is**
**always 'just', and your war is always 'unjust'. Buddhism does not**
**accept this position.**

**The Buddha not only taught non-violence and peace, but he**
**even went to the field of battle itself and intervened personally,**
**and prevented war, as in the case of the dispute between the**
**Sakyas and the Koliyas, who were prepared to fight over the**
**question of the waters of the Rohini. And his words once**
**prevented King Ajatasattu from attacking the kingdom of the**
**Vajjis.**

**In the days of the Buddha, as today, there were rulers who gov-**
**erned** **their** **countries** **unjustly.** **People** **were** **oppressed** **and**
**exploited, tortured and persecuted, excessive taxes were imposed**
**and cruel punishments were inflicted. The Buddha was deeply**
**moved by these inhumanities. The** **records**
_**Dhammapadatthakatha.**_
**that he, therefore, directed his attention to the problem of good**
**government. His views should be appreciated against the social,**
**economic and political background of his time. He had shown**
**how a whole country could become corrupt, degenerate and un-**
**happy when the heads of its government, that is the king, the**
**ministers and administrative officers become corrupt and unjust.**
**For a country to be happy it must have a just government. H o w**
**this form of just government could be realized is explained by the**
**Buddha in his teaching of the 'Ten Dudes of the King' (** _**dasa-raja-**_
_**dhamma**_ **), as given in the** _**Jataka**_ **text.** **[1 ]**



**Of course the term 'king' (R** _**dja)**_ **of old should be replaced today**



**1**
**Jataka I, 160, 599; II, 400; III, 274, 320; V, 119, 378.**

**by the term 'Government'. 'The Ten Duties of the King', therefore,**
**apply today to all those who constitute the government, such as the**
**head of the state, ministers, political leaders, legislative and**
**administrative officers, etc.**

**The first of the 'Ten Duties of the King' is liberality, generosity,**
**charity (** _**dana**_ **). The ruler should not have craving and attachment**
**to wealth and property, but should give it away for the welfare of**
**the people.**

**Second:** **A** **high** **moral** **character** **He** **should** **never**
_**(si/a).**_
**destroy life, cheat, steal and exploit others, commit adultery, utter**
**falsehood, and take intoxicating drinks. That is, he must at least**
**observe the Five Precepts of the layman.**

**Third:** **Sacrificing everything for the good of the people**
**he must be prepared to give up all personal comfort,**
_**(pariccaga),**_
**name and fame, and even his life, in the interest of the people.**

**Fourth: Honesty and integrity** **He must be free from**
_**(ajjava).**_
**fear or favour in the discharge of his duties, must be sincere in his**
**intentions, and must not deceive the public.**

**Fifth: Kindness and gentleness** **He must possess a**
_**(maddava).**_
**genial temperament.**

**Sixth: Austerity in habits** **He must lead a simple life, and**
_**(tapa).**_
**should not indulge in a life of luxury. He must have self-control.**

**Seventh: Freedom from hatred, ill-will, enmity** **He**
_**(akkodha).**_
**should bear no grudge against anybody.**

**Eighth: Non-violence** **which means not only that he**
_**(avihimsa),**_
**should harm nobody, but also that he should try to promote**
**peace by avoiding and preventing war, and everything which**
**involves violence and destruction of life.**

**Ninth: Patience, forbearance, tolerance, understanding**
_**(khanti).**_
**He must be able to bear hardships, difficulties and insults without**
**losing his temper.**

**Tenth: Non-opposition, non-obstruction** **that is to**
_**(avirodha),**_
**say that he should not oppose the will of the people, should not**
**obstruct any measures that are conducive to the welfare of the**
**people. In other words he should rule in harmony with his people.** **[1 ]**

**It is interesting to note here that the Five Principles or** _Pancba-stla_ **in India's**
**foreign policy are in accordance with the Buddhist principles which Asoka, the great**
**Buddhist emperor of India, applied to the administration of his government in the**
**3rd century B.C. The expression** _Pancha-sila_ **(Five Precepts or Virtues), is itself a**
**Buddhist term.**


85


**If a country is ruled by men endowed with such qualities, it is**
**needless to say that that country must be happy. But this was not a**
**Utopia, for there were kings in the past like Asoka of India who**
**had established kingdoms based on these ideas.**

**The world today lives in constant fear, suspicion, and tension.**
**Science has produced weapons which are capable of unimaginable**
**destruction. Brandishing these new instruments of death, great**
**powers threaten and challenge one another, boasting shamelessly**
**that one could cause more destruction and misery in the world**
**than the other.**

**They have gone along this path of madness to such a point that,**
**now, if they take one more step forward in that direction, the**
**result will be nothing but mutual annihilation along with the total**
**destruction of humanity.**

**Human beings in fear of the situation they have themselves**
**created, want to find a way out, and seek some kind of solution.**
**But there is none except that held out by the Buddha—his message**
**of non-violence and peace, of love and compassion, of tolerance**
**and understanding, of truth and wisdom, of respect and regard**
**for all life, of freedom from selfishness, hatred and violence.**

**The Buddha says: 'Never by hatred is hatred appeased, but it**
**is appeased by kindness. This is an eternal truth.'** **[1 ]**

**'One should win anger through kindness, wickedness through**
**goodness, selfishness through charity, and falsehood through**
**truthfulness.'** **[2 ]**

**There can be no peace or happiness for man as long as he desires**
**and thirsts after conquering and subjugating his neighbour. As**
**the Buddha says: 'The victor breeds hatred, and the defeated lies**
**down in misery. He w h o renounces both victory and defeat is**
**happy and peaceful.'** **[3]** **The only conquest that brings peace and**
**happiness is self-conquest. 'One may conquer millions in battle,**
**but he who conquers himself, only one, is the greatest of con-**
**querors.'** **[4 ]**

**Y o u will say this is all very beautiful, noble and sublime, but**
**impractical. Is it practical to hate one another? To kill one**


**1**
**Dhp. 15.**

**2**
_4Ibid.3Ibid._ **Ibid. x v n 5. VIII 4. XV 5.**


86


**another ? To live in eternal fear and suspicion like wild animals in**
**a jungle? Is this more practical and comfortable? Was hatred**
**ever appeased by hatred ? Was evil ever won over by evil ? But there**
**are examples, at least in individual cases, where hatred is appeased**
**by love and kindness, and evil won over by goodness. Y o u will say**
**that this may be true, practicable in individual cases, but that it never**
**works in national and international affairs. People are hypnotized,**
**psychologically puzzled, blinded and deceived by the political**
**and propaganda usage of such terms as 'national', 'international',**
**or 'state'. What is a nation but a vast conglomeration of indivi-**
**duals ? A nation or a state does not act, it is the individual who acts.**
**What the individual thinks and does is what the nation or the state**
**thinks and does. What is applicable to the individual is applicable**
**to the nation or the state. If hatred can be appeased by love and**
**kindness on the individual scale, surely it can be realized on the**
**national and international scale too. Even in the case of a single**
**person, to meet hatred with kindness one must have tremendous**
**courage, boldness, faith and confidence in moral force. May it not**
**be even more so with regard to international affairs ? If by the**
**expression 'not practical' you mean 'not easy', you are right.**
**Definitely it is not easy. Yet it should be tried. Y o u may say it is**
**risky trying it. Surely it cannot be more risky than trying a nuclear**
**war.**


**It is a consolation and inspiration to think today that at least**
**there was one great ruler, well known in history, who had the**
**courage, the confidence and the vision to apply this teaching of**
**non-violence, peace and love to the administration of a vast**
**empire, in both internal and external affairs—Asoka, the great**
**Buddhist emperor of India (3 rd century B.C.)—'the Beloved of the**
**gods' as he was called.**

**At first he followed the example of his father (Bindusara) and**
**grandfather (Chandragupta), and wished to complete the conquest**
**of the Indian peninsula. He invaded and conquered Kalinga, and**
**annexed it. Many hundreds of thousands were killed, wounded,**
**tortured and taken prisoner in this war. But later, when he became**
**a Buddhist, he was completely changed and transformed by the**
**Buddha's teachings. In one of his famous Edicts, inscribed on rock,**
**(Rock Edict XIII, as it is now called), the original of which one**
**may read even today, referring to the conquest of Kalinga, the**


87


**Emperor publicly expressed his** **'repentance',** **and said how**
**'extremely painful' it was for him to think of that carnage. He**
**publicly declared that he would never draw his sword again for**
**any conquest, but that he 'wishes all living beings non-violence,**
**self control, the practice of serenity and mildness. This, of course,**
**is considered the chief conquest by the Beloved of the gods (i.e.,**
**Asoka), namely the conquest by piety** _(dhamma-vijaja).'_ **Not only did**
**he renounce war himself, he expressed his desire that 'my sons and**
**grandsons will not think of a new conquest as worth achieving...**
**let them think of that conquest only which is the conquest by**
**piety. That is good for this world and the world beyond.'**

**This is the only example in the history of mankind of a victor-**
**ious conquerer at the zenith of his power, still possessing the**
**strength to continue his territorial conquests, yet renouncing war**
**and violence and turning to peace and non-violence.**

**Here is a lesson for the world today. The ruler of an empire**
**publicly turned his back on war and violence and embraced the**
**message of peace and non-violence. There is no historical evidence**
**to show that any neighbouring king took advantage of Asoka's**
**piety to attack him militarily, or that there was any revolt or**
**rebellion within his empire during his lifetime. On the contrary**
**there was peace throughout the land, and even countries outside**
**his empire seem to have accepted his benign leadership.**

**To talk of maintaining peace through the balance of power, or**
**through the threat of nuclear deterrents, is foolish. The might of**
**armaments can only produce fear, and not peace. It is impossible**
**that there can be genuine and lasting peace through fear. Through**
**fear can come only hatred, ill-will and hostility, suppressed per-**
**haps for the time being only, but ready to erupt and become**
**violent at any moment. True and genuine peace can prevail only**
**in an atmosphere of** _metta,_ **amity, free from fear, suspicion and**
**danger.**

**Buddhism aims at creating a society where the ruinous struggle**
**for power is renounced; where calm and peace prevail away from**
**conquest and defeat; where the persecution of the innocent is**
**vehemently denounced; where one who conquers oneself is more**
**respected than those who conquer millions by military and econo-**
**mic warfare; where hatred is conquered by kindness, and evil by**
**goodness; where enmity, jealousy, ill-will and greed do not infect**


88


**men's minds; where compassion is the driving force of action;**
**where all, including the least of living things, are treated with**
**fairness, consideration and love; where life in peace and harmony,**
**in a world of material contentment, is directed towards the highest**
**and noblest aim, the realization of the Ultimate Truth, Nirvana.**

### Selected Texts

**A word of explanation may help the modern reader to understand**
**and appreciate the style of the original Pali texts selected for**
**translation here.**

**Three months after the Buddha's** **(death), a Council**
_**Parinirvana**_
**of the disciples closely associated with him was held, at which**
**all his teaching, discourses and rules of discipline, as they were**
**remembered, were recited, approved as authentic, and classified**
**into** **five** **Collections,** **called** **which** **constitute** **the**
_**Nikayas,**_
**(Triple Canon).** **These Collections were entrusted to**
_**Tipitaka**_
**various Theras or Elders and to their pupilary succession for**
**oral transmission for the benefit of future generations.**

**In order to perpetuate an unbroken and authentic oral trans-**
**mission, regular and systematic recitation is necessary.** **It must**
**be particularly noted that this recitation was not the act of** a
**single individual alone, but of a group.** **The purpose of this**
**mode of collective recitation was to keep the texts intact, free**
**from change, modification or interpolation.** **If one member of**
**the group forgot a word, another would remember it; or if one**
**modified, added or omitted a word or a phrase, another would**
**correct him.** **In this way, it was hoped, nothing could be**
**changed, modified,** **added or omitted.** **Texts** **handed down**
**through an unbroken oral tradition of this kind were considered**
**more reliable and authentic than any record of the teachings set**
**down by a single individual alone many years after the death of**
**their promulgator.** **The teachings of the Buddha were com-**
**mitted to writing for the first time at a Council in the first century**
**B.C.—held in Ceylon four centuries after his death. Up to that**
**time, the whole of the** **had been handed down from**
_**Tipitaka**_
**generation to generation in this unbroken oral tradition.**

**The original texts are in Pali, a language soft, melodious and**
**smooth-flowing. Their frequent repetitions, the use of cate-**
**gories, not only help memorization, which is necessary for the**


[1 ]
9


**continuity of oral tradition, but also give them poetic beauty**
**and charm. They use poetic rhythms and have all the grace of**
**poetry. The recitation of these texts in the original Pali in the**
**calm atmosphere of a tropical grove or in a monastery still**
**produces beautiful, harmonious and serene effects. The sonorous**
**Pali words, their grandeur, and the well-known cadence of**
**repetitions, produce the effect, even for someone who does not**
**know their meaning, of a solemn chant in an unknown tongue.**
**Recitation of this kind with its conventional melodic line, was**
**so peaceful and moving that some narratives related that the**
**deities in the woods were sometimes fascinated and attracted by it.**

**In** **the following** **selections from the** **original Canon** **the**
**repetitions are rendered in full only in some places in order to**
**give the reader an idea of their style.** **In other places they**
**are indicated by dots. I have tried to render the original Pali**
**as closely as possible into English without offending either the**
**sense and tone of the Buddha's words or modern English**
**usage.**

_**(Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta)**_
**(The First Sermon of the Buddha)**


**Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once living in the**
**Deer Park at Isipatana (the Resort** **of Seers)** **near** **Baranasi**
**(Benares).** **There he addressed the group of five bhikkhus:**
**'Bhikkhus, these two extremes ought not to be practised by one**
**who has gone forth from the household life. What are the two ?**
**There is devotion to the indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is**
**low,** **common,** **the way** **of ordinary people,** **unworthy** **and**
**unprofitable; and there is devotion to self-mortification, which is**
**painful, unworthy and unprofitable.**

**'Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata has realized the**
**Middle Path: it gives vision, it gives knowledge, and it leads to**
**calm, to insight, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. And what is that**


92


**Middle Path . . . ? It is simply the Noble Eightfold Path, namely,**
**right view, right thought,** **right speech, right action,** **right**
**livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.**
**This is the Middle Path realized by the Tathagata, which gives**
**vision, which gives knowledge, and which leads to calm, to**
**insight, to enlightenment, to Nibbana.**

**'The Noble Truth of suffering** **is this:** **Birth is**
_**(Dukkha)**_
**suffering; aging is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is**
**suffering; sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair are**
**suffering; association with the unpleasant is suffering; dissocia-**
**tion from the pleasant is suffering; not to get what one wants is**
**suffering—in brief, the five aggregates of attachment are suffering.**

**'The Noble Truth of the origin of suffering is this: It is this**
**thirst (craving) which produces re-existence and re-becoming,**
**bound up with passionate greed.** **It finds fresh delight now**
**here and now there, namely, thirst for sense-pleasures; thirst for**
**existence and becoming;** **and** **thirst for non-existence (self-**
**annihilation).**

**'The Noble Truth of the Cessation of suffering is this: It is**
**the complete cessation of that very thirst, giving it up, renouncing**
**it, emancipating oneself from it, detaching oneself from it.**

**'The Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of**
**suffering is this: It is simply the Noble Eightfold Path, namely**
**right view; right thought; right speech, right action; right**
**livelihood; right effort; right mindfulness; right concentration.**

**' "This is the Noble Truth of Suffering (Dukkha)": such was**
**the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light,**
**that arose in me with regard to things not heard before. "This**
**suffering, as a noble truth, should be fully understood": such was**
**the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light, that**
**arose in me with regard to things not heard before. "This suffer-**
**ing, as a noble truth, has been fully understood": such was the**
**vision, the knowledge, the wisdom, the science, the light, that**
**arose in me with regard to things not heard before.**

**' "This is the Noble Truth of the Origin of suffering": such was**
**the vision . . . "This Origin of suffering, as a noble truth,**
**should be abandoned" : such was the vision, . . . "This Origin**
**of suffering, as a noble truth, has been abandoned": such was**
**the vision, . . . with regard to things not heard before.**


93


**"This is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of suffering":**
**such was the vision . . . "This Cessation of suffering, as a noble**
**truth,** **should be realized":** **such was** **the vision, . . . "This**
**Cessation of suffering, as a noble truth, has been realized":**
**such was the vision, . . . with regard to things not heard**
**before.**

**' "This is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation**
**of suffering": such was the vision, . . . "This Path leading to the**
**Cessation of suffering, as a noble truth, should be followed**
**(cultivated)": such was the vision, . . . "This Path leading to the**
**Cessation of suffering, as a noble truth, has been followed**
**(cultivated)": such was the vision, the knowledge, the wisdom,**
**the science, the light, that arose in me with regard to things**
**not heard before.**

**'As long as my vision of true knowledge was not fully clear in**
**these three aspects, in these twelve ways, regarding the Four**
**Noble Truths,** **[1]** **I did not claim to have realized the perfect**
**Enlightenment that is supreme in the world with its gods, with**
**its Maras and Brahmas, in this world with its recluses and**
**brahmanas, with its princes and men.** **But when my vision**
**of true knowledge was fully clear in these three aspects, in these**
**twelve ways, regarding the Four Noble Truths, then I claimed**
**to have realized the perfect Enlightenment that is supreme in the**
**world with its gods, its Maras and Brahmas, in this world with its**
**recluses and brahmanas, with its princes and men. A n d a vision**
**of true knowledge arose in me thus: My heart's deliverance is**
**unassailable. This is the last birth. N o w there is no more re-**
**becoming (rebirth).**

**This the Blessed One said. The group of five bhikkhus was**
**glad, and they rejoiced at his words.**

_**(Samyutta-nikaya, LVI,**_ _**n)**_


**1**
**As may be seen from the four preceding paragraphs, with regard to each of the**
**Four Noble Truths there are three aspects of knowledge: i. The knowledge that it is**
**the Truth (** _sacca-nana) z._ **The knowledge that a certain function or action with**
**regard to this Truth should be performed (** _kicca-nana),_ **and 3. The knowledge that**
**that function or action with regard to this Truth has been performed (** _kata-hana)._
**When these three aspects are applied to each of the Four Noble Truths, twelve**
**ways are obtained.**

**Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once living at Gayasisa**
**in Gaya with a thousand bhikkhus. There he addressed the bhik-**

**'Bhikkhus, all is burning. A n d what is the all that is burning ?**

**'Bhikkhus, the eye is burning, visible forms are burning,**
**visual consciousness is burning, visual impression is burning,**
**also whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither-painful-**

**burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with**
**the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion; I say it is burning with**
**birth, aging and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with**
**pains, with griefs, with despairs.**

**'The ear is burning, sounds are burning, auditory conscious-**

**Burning with what ? Burning with the fire of lust. . . .**

**is called** _The Fire Sermon._ **In the note to line 308: 'Burning burning burning burning',**
**Eliot writes: 'The complete text of the Buddha's Fire Sermon (which corresponds in**
**importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which these words are taken, will**

**consciousness is burning, gustative impression is burning, also**
**whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-**

**burning. Burning with what ? Burning with the fire of lust. . . .**

**'The body is burning, tangible things are burning, tactile**
**consciousness is burning, tactile impression is burning, also**
**whatever sensation, pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-**

**This the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were glad, and they**

**While this exposition was being delivered, the minds of those**

**He who is skilled in good and who wishes to attain that state of**
**Calm should act (thus):**

**He should be able, upright, perfectly upright, compliant, gentle,**
**and humble.**

**Contented, easily supported, with few dudes, of simple liveli-**
**hood, controlled in senses, discreet, not impudent, he should**
**not be greedily attached to families.**

**He should not commit any slight wrong such that other wise**
**men might censure him. (Then he should cultivate his thoughts**
**thus:)**

**May all beings be happy and secure; may their minds be**
**contented.**

**Whatever living beings there may be—feeble or strong, long**
**(or tall), stout, or medium, short, small, or large, seen or unseen,**
**those dwelling far or near, those who are born and those who are**
**yet to be born—may all beings, without exception, be happy-**

**Let not one deceive another nor despise any person whatever**
**in any place. In anger or illwill let not one wish any harm to**

**Just as a mother would protect her only child even at the risk**

**Blessing.**

**To reside in a suitable locality, to have done meritorious actions**

**Patience,** **obedience,** **seeing the** **Samanas (holy men),** **and**

**Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once living at the**
**monastery** **of Anathapindika** **in** **Jeta's** **grove** **near** **Savatthi.**
**There he addressed the bhikkhus saying: 'Bhikkhus', and they**
**replied to him:** **'Venerable Sir.' The Blessed One spoke as**

**'Bhikkhus, I will expound to you the method of restraining**
**all cares and troubles.** **[1]** **Listen and reflect well; I shall speak to**
**you'. 'Yes, Venerable Sir,' they said in response to the Blessed One.**


**He then spoke as follows:**

**'Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction (getting rid) of cares and**
**troubles is (possible) for one who knows and who sees, not for**
**one who does not know and does not see. What must a person**
**know and see in order that the destruction (getting rid) of**
**cares and troubles should be possible ? (These are) wise reflection**
**and unwise reflection. For a person who reflects unwisely there**
**arise cares and troubles which have not yet arisen, and (in addi-**
**tion), those which have already arisen increase. But for him who**

**The term** _asava_ **in this** _Sutta_ **has wider senses than its usual psychological and**
**ethical meanings such as 'influx', 'outflow', 'defilement', 'impurity'. It is here used**
**figuratively and embraces both psychological cares and physical troubles and**
**difficulties as can be seen in the sequel.**

**reflects wisely, cares and troubles which have not yet arisen do**
**not arise, and (in addition), those already arisen disappear.**

**'Bhikkhus, (i) there are cares and troubles which are to be**
**got rid of by insight; (2) there are cares and troubles which are**
**to be got rid of by restraint; (3) there are cares and troubles which**
**are to be got rid of by use; (4) there are cares and troubles which**
**are to be got rid of by endurance; (5) there are cares and troubles**
**which are to be got rid of by avoidance; (6) there are cares and**
**troubles which are to be got rid of by dispersal; (7) there are cares**
**and troubles which are to be got rid of by culture.**

**(1) 'Bhikkhus, what are the cares and troubles which are to be**

**in this way:**

**2.** **Did I not exist in the past?**

**j.** **What was I in the past?**

**4.** **H o w was I in the past ?**

**10.** **Having been what, shall I become what in future?**
**Or, now at the present time he is doubtful about himself:**

**1 1 . A m i ?**
**12. Am I not?**

**13. What am I?**

**14. H o w am I ?**


**16. Whither will he go ?**
**When he reflects unwisely in this -way, one of the six false views**
**arises in him:**

**1.** **I have a Self: this view arises in him as true and real.**
**2.** **I have no Self: this view arises in him as true and real.**

**3.** **By Self I perceive Self: this view arises in him as true and**

**4.** **By Self I perceive non-self: this view arises in him as true**

**5.** **By non-self I perceive Self: this view arises in him as**
**true and real.**

**6.** **Or a wrong view arises in him as follows: This my**
**Self, which speaks and feels, which experiences the fruits of**
**good and bad actions now here and now there, this Self is perma-**
**nent, stable, everlasting, unchanging, remaining the same for**
**ever and ever.**

**'This, Bhikkhus, is what is called becoming enmeshed in views;**
**a jungle of views, a wilderness of views; scuffling in views,**
**the agitation (struggle) of views, the fetter of views. Bhikkhus,**
**the uninstructed ordinary man fettered by the fetters of views,**
**does not liberate himself from birth, aging and death, from**
**sorrows, lamentations, pains, griefs, despairs; I say that he does**
**not liberate himself from suffering (** _**dukkha).**_

**who is well trained in the Teachings of the Noble Ones, who sees**

**'Bhikkhus,** **a bhikkhu,** **considering** **wisely,** **lives** **with his**

**(3)** **'Bhikkhus, what are the cares and troubles to be got rid**

**and to cover himself decently.** **Considering wisely, he makes**

**the holy life, thinking: In this way I put out the feeling (of**

**" T h e Blessed One is Worthy, Perfecdy Enlightened, Endowed**

**tamer of men, Teacher of gods and men, Awakened and Blessed."**
**He finds serene joy (satisfaction) in the Dhamma: (knowing that)**
**" T h e Dhamma is excellently expounded by the Blessed One;**
**it can be realized here in this life; it produces immediate results;**
**it invites people to come and see (investigate); it leads to the goal**
**(Nibbana); it has to be comprehended by the wise, each for**
**himself." He finds serene joy (satisfaction) in the Community of**
**the Disciples: (knowing that) " T h e Community of the Disciples**
**of the Blessed One is of good conduct, upright, wise, dutiful.**
**The Community of the Disciples of the Blessed One: namely,**
**the Four Pairs of Persons, the Eight kinds of Individuals,** **[1]** **is**
**worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts, of reverential saluta-**
**tion, it is an incomparable field of merit to the world."**

**'Finally, with impurities renounced, spewed out, discharged,**
**abandoned, and with the thought that he is endowed with**
**serene joy in the Enlightened One—in his Teaching**
_**(Dhamma)—**_
**in the Community—he is touched with a feeling for the Sense**
**and the Truth, and he receives the gladness associated with**
**Truth; when one is glad, joy arises; when the mind is joyful,**
**the body becomes relaxed; when relaxed, one feels content:**
**the mind of the contented man is concentrated.**

**'A bhikkhu who has reached this state in virtue, in mental**
**discipline and in wisdom, may, without impediment (to his**

**sauces and curries. Just as a soiled and dirty cloth, plunged in**

**who has reached this state in virtue, in mental discipline and in**
**wisdom, may partake of the choicest rice with all manner of**
**sauces and curries, and it will not be an impediment (harm) to**
**him (to his spiritual life).**


**l**
**The Four Pairs of Persons constitute the four kinds of disciples who have**
**attained the four Paths and the four Fruits of Sainthood, namely,** _Sotapatti_
**(Stream-Entrant),** _Sakaddgami_ **(Once-Returner),** _Anagdmi_ **(Never-Returner), and**
_Arahatta_ **(Worthy). The one who has attained the Path and the one who has attained**
**the Fruit of each of the four stages of Sainthood are once taken together and**
**considered as a Pair. Hence the Four Pairs of Persons. And then when the two per-**
**sons of each Pair are regarded separately, there are eight Individuals.**

**'With thoughts of love—of compassion—of sympathetic joy—**
**of equanimity—he pervades one quarter of the world, so too the**
**second, the third and the fourth quarters, above, below, across,**
**everywhere; the whole length and breadth of the wide world is**
**pervaded by the radiant thoughts of a mind all-embracing,**
**vast and boundless, without hate, without ill-will.**

**'Then he knows: "There is this; there is a lower and there is**
**yet a higher stage; Deliverance lies beyond this realm of percep-**
**tions." When he knows and sees this, his mind becomes liberated**
**from the impurities of sense-pleasure, of (the desire for) continu-**
**ing existence, of ignorance. When liberated, there is knowledge**
**that he is liberated. Then he knows: "Birth is exhausted, the**
**holy life has been lived, what has to be done is done, there is no**
**more left to be done on this account." Bhikkhus, such a bhikkhu**
**can be said to have bathed internally.'**

**N o w at this time there was sitting close by the Brahmin**
**Sundarika-Bharadvaja who asked the Blessed One thus: 'Does**
**the Venerable Gotama go to bathe in the river Bahuka?'**

**'What does the river Bahuka matter, Brahmin? What (good)**
**does it do ?'**

**'Venerable Gotama, the river Bahuka is considered by many**
**people as purifying, as holy. Many people wash away their sins**
**in the river Bahuka.'**

**Thereupon the Blessed One addressed the Brahmin Sundarika-**
**Bharadvaja in these lines:**

**'In Bahuka and in Adhikakka,**
**Gaya, Sundarika, Srassati,**

**Payaga, Bahumati—there the fool of black deeds**
**May daily plunge, yet is never purified.**
**What can Sundarika, Payaga or Bahumati do ?**
**They cleanse not the man guilty of hate and evil.**
**For him who is pure (in mind) any day is auspicious, any day is**
**hallowed.**

**Cleansed, pure in deeds,**
**He always fulfils observances.**

**So, Brahmin, come and bathe here.**
**Love all that lives. If you neither lie, nor slay, nor steal,**
**Are no greedy miser but live in trust,**

**What use going to Gaya ? Your well at home is Gaya.'**


**108**


**At this the Brahmin Sundarika-Bharadvaja said to the Blessed**
**One: 'Excellent, Venerable Gotama, excellent! It is just as if one**
**should set upright what had been turned upside down, or reveal**
**what had been hidden away, or show the way to a man gone**
**astray, or bring a lamp into darkness so that those with eyes**
**might see things there. In this manner in many ways the Dhamma**
**is expounded by the Venerable Gotama. I take refuge in the**
**Venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma and in the Community of**
**Bhikkhus. May I be admitted into the Order and receive the**
**Higher Ordination under the Venerable Gotama.'**

**The Brahmin Sundarika-Bharadvaja was admitted into the**
**Order and received the Higher Ordination. N o t long after his**
**Higher Ordination, the Venerable Bharadvaja, dwelling alone**
**and aloof, strenuous, ardent, resolute, attained to and dwelt in**
**that incomparable State, the ultimate aim of holy life, in quest of**
**which sons of families go forth from home to homelessness.**
**And he knew through higher knowledge: 'Birth is exhausted,**
**the holy life has been lived, what has to be done is done, there is**
**no more left to be done on this account.' A n d in this way the**
**Venerable Bharadvaja, too, became one of the Arahants.**

**he knows "I am breathing out a short breath".**

**' "Experiencing the whole (breath-) body, I shall breathe i n " ;**
**thus he trains himself. "Experiencing the whole (breath-) body,**
**I shall breathe out": thus he trains himself. "Calming the activity**
**of the (breath-) body, I shall breath in": thus he trains himself.**
**"Calming the activity of the (breath-) body, I shall breathe out":**
**thus he trains himself. . . .**

**'Thus he lives observing (the activities of) the body internally,**
**or . . . externally, or . . . both internally and externally. He lives**
**also observing origination-factors in the body, or dissolution-**
**factors in the body, or origination-and-dissolution factors in the**
**body. Or his mindfulness is established to the extent necessary just**
**for knowledge and awareness that the body exists and he lives**
**unattached, and clings to naught in the world. In this way Bhik-**
**khus, a bhikkhu lives observing (the activities of) the body.**

**[2.** _**Postures of the body]**_

**'And further, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows when he is going,**
**"I am going". He knows when he is standing, "I am standing".**

**He knows when he is sitting, "I am sitting". He knows when he is**
**lying down, "I am lying down". Or he knows just how his body is**
**disposed.**

**'Thus he lives observing (the activities of) the body internally,**
**or externally . . .**

_**[3. Full Attention]**_

**'And further, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu applies full attention either**
**in going forward or back; in looking straight on or looking away;**
**in bending or in stretching; in wearing robes or carrying the**
**bowl; in eating, drinking, chewing or savouring; in attending**
**to the calls of nature; in walking, in standing, in sitting; in**
**falling asleep, in waking; in speaking or in keeping silence.**
**In all these he applies full attention.**

**'Thus he lives observing (the activities of) the body.**

**[4.** _**Kepulsiveness of the body]**_

**'And further, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body**
**enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity, from the**
**sole up, and from the top of the hair down, thinking thus:**
**"There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails,**
**teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver,**
**midriff, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, fasces, bile,**
**phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus,**
**synovial fluid, urine".**

**'Just as if there were a double-mouthed provision-bag full of**
**various kinds of grain such as hill paddy, paddy, green gram,**
**cow-peas, sesamum and husked rice, and a man with sound eyes,**
**having opened that bag, were to reflect thus: This is hill paddy,**
**this is paddy, this is green gram, this is cow-pea, this is sesamum,**
**this is husked rice, just so, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this**
**very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity,**
**from the sole up, and from the top of the hair down, thinking**
**thus: There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body,**
**nails, teeth . . . synovial fluid, urine.**

**'Thus he lives observing the body. . . .**

_**[5. Material Elements]**_

**' A n d further, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reflects on this very body,**
**as it is, and it is constituted, by way of the material elements:**
**"There are in this body the element of earth, the element of water,**
**the element of fire, the element of wind".**


h i


**'Just as if, Bhikkhus, a clever cow-butcher or his apprentice,**
**having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions, would**
**be sitting at the junction of four high roads; in the same way,**
**a bhikkhu reflects** oa **this very body, as it is, and it is constituted,**
**by way of the material elements: "There are in this body the**
**elements of earth, water, fire and wind".**

**'Thus he lives observing the body. . . .**

[6. _**Nine Cemetery Objects]**_

**(1)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**dead one, two, or three days, swollen, blue and festering, thrown**
**on to the cemetery, so he applies this perception to his own body**
**thus: "Verily, my own body, too, is of the same nature; such it**
**will become and will not escape it".**

**'Thus he lives observing the body. . . .**
**(2)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery, being eaten by crows, hawks,**
**vultures, dogs, jackals or by different kinds of worms, so he**
**applies this perception to his own body thus: "Verily, my own**
**body, too, is of the same nature; such it will become and will not**
**escape it".**

**'Thus he lives observing the body. . . .**

**(3)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to a skeleton with some**
**flesh and blood attached to it, held together by the tendons. . . .**

**(4)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to a skeleton, blood-be-**
**smeared and without flesh, held together by the tendons. . . .**

**(5)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to a skeleton without flesh**
**and blood, held together by the tendons. . . .**

**(6)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to disconnected bones,**
**scattered in all directions—here a bone of the hand, there a bone**
**of the foot, a shin bone, a thigh bone, the pelvis, spine and**
**skull**

**(7)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to bleached bones of conch-**
**like colour. . . .**

**(8)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**


**112**


**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to bones, more than a year**
**old, lying in a heap. . . .**

**(9)** **'And further, Bhikkhus, just as a bhikkhu sees a body**
**thrown on to the cemetery reduced to bones rotten and become**
**dust . . . so he applies this perception to his own body thus:**
**"Verily, my own body, too, is of the same nature; such it will**
**become and will not escape it".**

**'Thus he lives observing the body . . .'**


**[11. FEELINGS]**

**'And how Bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu live observing feelings ?**
**'Here, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu when experiencing a pleasant**
**feeling knows: "I experience a pleasant feeling"; when experienc-**
**ing a painful feeling, he knows: "I experience a painful feeling";**
**when** **experiencing** **a** **neither-pleasant-nor-painful** **feeling,** **he**
**knows:** **"I experience a neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling".**
**When experiencing a pleasant wordly feeling, he knows:** **"I**
**experience a pleasant worldly feeling"; when experiencing a**
**pleasant spiritual feeling, he knows: "I experience a pleasant**
**spiritual feeling"; when experiencing a painful worldly feeling,**
**he** **knows:** **"I experience a painful worldly feeling";** **when**
**experiencing a painful spiritual feeling, he knows: "I experience a**
**painful spiritual feeling"; when experiencing a neither-pleasant-**

**pleasant-nor-painful** **worldly** **feeling";** **when** **experiencing** **a**
**neither-pleasant-nor-painful** **spiritual** **feeling,** **he** **knows:** **"I**
**experience a neither-pleasant-nor-painful spiritual feeling".**

**'He lives in this way observing feelings internally, . . . or**
**externally, or . . . internally and externally. He lives observing**
**origination-factors in feelings, or dissolution-factors in feelings,**
**or origination-and-dissolution factors in feelings. Or his mindful-**
**ness is established to the extent necessary just for knowledge and**
**awareness that feeling exists, and he lives unattached, and clings**
**to naught in the world. In this way, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives**
**observing feelings.'**

**[III. MIND]**

**'And how, Bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu live observing mind?**
**'Here Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the mind with lust, as being**

**with lust; the mind without lust, as being without lust; the**
**mind with hate, as being with hate; the mind without hate, as**
**being without hate; the mind with ignorance, as being with**
**ignorance;** **the** **mind** **without** **ignorance,** **as** **being** **without**
**ignorance; the shrunken state of mind as the shrunken state;**
**the distracted state of mind as the distracted state; the developed**
**state of mind as the developed state; the undeveloped state of**
**mind as the undeveloped state; the state of mind with some other**
**mental state superior to it, as being the state with something**
**mentally superior to it; the state of mind with no other mental**
**state superior to it, as being the state with nothing mentally**
**superior to it; the concentrated state of mind as the concentrated**
**state; the unconcentrated state of mind as the unconcentrated**
**state; the liberated state of mind as the liberated state; and the**
**unliberated state of mind as the unliberated state.**

**'He lives in this way observing the mind internally, or exter-**

**He lives observing origination-factors in mind or dissolution-**
**factors in mind or origination-and-dissolution-factors in mind.**
**Or his mindfulness is established to the extent necessary just**
**for knowledge and awareness that mind exists, and he lives**
**unattached, and clings to naught in the world. Thus, Bhikkhus,**

**objects ?**

_**[Five Hindrances ]**_

**'Here, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives observing the Five Hind-**
**rances as mental objects.**

**'How, Bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu live observing the Five**
**Hindrances as mental objects ?**

**(i)** **'Here, Bhikkhus, when sense-desire is present, a bhikkhu**
**knows: "Sense-desire is in me", or when sense-desire is not**
**present, he knows: "There is no sense-desire in me". He knows**
**how the non-arisen sense-desire arises; he knows how the arisen**
**sense-desire disappears; and he knows how the non-arising in the**
**future of the abandoned sense-desire comes to be.**


**114**


**(2)** **'When anger is present, he knows: " A n g e r is in me". .. .**

**"Restlessness and worry are in m e "**

**(5)** **'When doubt is present, he knows: "Doubt is in me",**
**or when doubt is not present, he knows, "There is no doubt in**
**me". He knows how the non-arisen doubt arises; he knows how**
**the arisen doubt disappears; and he knows how the non-arising**
**in the future of the abandoned doubt comes to be.**

**'In this way he lives observing mental objects internally, or**
**externally,** **or internally** **and** **externally.** **He lives** **observing**
**origination-factors in mental objects, or dissolution-factors in**
**mental objects, or originadon- and dissolution-factors in mental**
**objects. Or his mindfulness is established to the extent necessary**

**rances as mental objects.**

_**[Five Aggregates]**_

**'And further, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives observing the five**
**aggregates of clinging as mental objects.**

**'How, Bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu live observing (contemplating)**
**the five aggregates of clinging as mental objects ?**

**'Here, Bhikkhus, a bhikku thinks: Thus is material form;**
**it arises in this way; and it disappears in this way. Thus is feeling;**
**it arises in this way; and it disappears in this way. Thus is percep-**
**tion; it arises in this way; and it disappears in this way. Thus are**
**mental formations; they arise in this way; and they disappear**
**in this way. Thus is consciousness; it arises in this way; and it**
**disappears in this way.**

**'Thus he lives contemplating mental objects internally, etc. . . .**

**aggregates of clinging as mental objects.**

_**[j'/x Sense-Bases]**_

**'And further, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu lives contemplating the six**

**internal and the six external sense-bases as mental objects.**

**'How, Bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu live contemplating the six**
**internal and the six external sense-bases as mental objects ?**

**'Here, Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu knows the eye and visual forms,**
**and the fetter that arises dependent on both (the eye and forms);**
**he knows how the non-arisen fetter arises; he knows how the**
**arisen fetter disappears; and he knows how the non-arising in**
**the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be.**

**'He knows the ear and sounds . . . the nose and smells . . . the**
**tongue and flavours . . . the body and tangible objects . . . the**
**mind and mental objects, and the fetter that arises dependent**

_**(Majjhima Nikaya,**_


**A D V I C E** **T O** **S I G A L A**

**(Domestic and Social Relations)**
_**(Sigalovada-sutta)**_
**(Abridged)**


**Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once staying near**
**Rajagaha at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground in the Bamboo Wood.**

**N o w at this time Sigala, a householder's son, rising early,**
**went out of Rajagaha. With wet hair, wet garments and his**
**clasped hands uplifted, he performed the rite of worship to the**
**several quarters of earth and sky: to the east, south, west, and**
**north, to the nadir and the zenith.** **[1 ]**

**Early that same morning, the Blessed One dressed, took bowl**
**and robe and entered Rajagaha seeking alms. He saw Sigala at**
**his rite of worship and spoke to him thus:**

**'Why, young householder, do you, rising early and leaving**
**Rajagaha, with your hair and raiment wet, worship the several**
**quarters of earth and sky ?'**

**'Sir, my father, when he was on his death-bed, said to me:**
**"Dear son, you should worship the quarters of earth and sky."**
**So I, sir, honouring my father's word, reverencing, revering,**

**Performing the rite of worship of the different quarters of the external world,**
**invoking, for protection, the mighty spirits or gods inhabiting them, was an old**
**ritual according to the Vedic tradition. The Buddha, who disapproves and con-**
**demns such superstitious, old practices, gives them new meanings and interpreta-**
**tions, according to the persons to whom he speaks. Cf. 'The Parable of the Piece of**
**Cloth* where he speaks to a brahmin of the 'inner bath' instead of 'sacred baths in**
**holy rivers', (p. 108.)**

**holding it sacred, rise early and, leaving Rajagaha, worship in this**
**way.'**

**'But in the Discipline of the Arya (Noble One), young house-**
**holder, the six quarters should not be worshipped in this way.'**

**' H o w then, sir, in the Discipline of the Arya, should the six**
**quarters be worshipped ? It would be an excellent thing, if the**
**Blessed One would so teach me the way in which according to**
**the Discipline of the Arya, the six quarters should be worshipped.'**

**'Hear then, young householder, reflect carefully and I will**
**tell you.'**

**'Yes, sir,' responded young Sigala. And the Blessed One said:**
**'Just as, young householder, the Aryan disciple has put away**
**the four vices in conduct; just as he does no evil actions from the**
**four motives; just as he does not make towards the six doors of**
**dissipating wealth; avoiding these fourteen evil things, he is a**
**guardian of the six quarters, is on his way to conquer both worlds,**
**is successful both in this world and in the next. At the dissolution**
**of the body, after death, he is reborn to a happy destiny in heaven.**

**'What are the four vices of conduct that he has put away?**
**The destruction of life, stealing, adultery, and lying.** **These**
**are the four vices of conduct that he has put away.**


**'By which four motives does he do no evil actions? Evil**
**actions are done from motives of partiality, enmity, stupidity**
**and fear. But as the Aryan disciple is not led away by these motives**
**he does no evil actions through them.**


**'And which are the six doors of dissipating wealth? Drink;**
**frequenting** **the** **streets** **at** **unseemly hours;** **haunting** **fairs;**
**gambling; associating with evil friends; idleness.**

**'There are, young householder, these six dangers of drink:**
**the actual loss of wealth; increase of quarrels; susceptibility to**
**disease; an evil reputation; indecent exposure; ruining one's**
**intelligence.**

**'Six, young householder, are the perils a man runs through**
**frequenting the streets at unseemly hours: he himself is un-**
**guarded or unprotected and so too are his wife and children;**
**so also is his property (wealth); in addition he falls under the**
**suspicion of being** **responsible for undetected** **crimes;** **false**


120


**rumours are attached to his name; he goes out to meet many**
**troubles.**

**'There are six perils in haunting fairs: A man keeps looking**
**about to see where is there dancing? where is there singing?**
**music ? recitation ? cymbal playing ? the beating of tam-tams ?**

**'Six, young householder, are the perils of gambling: if the man**
**wins, he is hated; if he loses, he mourns his lost wealth; waste**
**of wealth; his word has no weight in an assembly (a court of law);**
**he is despised by his friends and companions; he is not sought**
**in marriage, for people will say that a man who is a gambler**
**will never make a good husband.**

**'There are six perils of associating with evil friends: any**
**gambler, any libertine, any tippler, any cheat, any swindler,**
**any man of violence becomes his friend and companion.**

**'There are six perils in idleness: A man says, it is too cold,**
**and does no work. He says, it is too hot, and does no work;**
**he says, it is too early . . . too late, and does no work. He says,**
**I am too hungry, and does no w o r k . . . too full, and does no work.**
**A n d while all that he should do remains undone, he makes no**
**money, and such wealth as he has dwindles away.**


**'Four persons should be reckoned as foes in the likeness of**
**friends: the rapacious person; the man who pays lip-service only**
**to a friend; the flatterer; the wastrel.**

**'Of these the first is to be reckoned as a foe in the likeness of a**
**friend on four grounds: he is rapacious; he gives little and**
**expects much; he does what he has to do out of fear; he pursues**
**his own interests.**

**'On four grounds the man who pays lip-service only to a friend**
**is to be reckoned as a foe in the likeness of a friend: he makes**
**friendly professions as regards the past; he makes friendly**
**professions as regards the future; the only service he renders is**
**by his empty sayings; when the opportunity for service arises**
**he shows his unreliability.**

**'On four grounds the flatterer is to be reckoned as a foe**
**in the likeness of a friend: he approves your bad deeds, as well**
**as your good deeds; he praises you to your face, and in your**
**absence he speaks ill of you.**

**'On four grounds the wastrel is to be reckoned as a foe in the**


**likeness of a friend: he is your companion when you go drinking;**

**when you frequent the streets at untimely hours; when you**

**haunt shows and fairs; when you gamble.**


**'The friends who should be reckoned as good-hearted (friends)**
**are four: the helper; the friend who is constant in happiness and**
**adversity; the friend of good counsel; the sympathetic friend.**

**'The friend who is a helper is to be reckoned as good-hearted**
**on four grounds: he protects you when you are taken unawares;**
**he protects your property when you are not there to protect it;**
**he is a refuge to you when you are afraid; when you have tasks**
**to perform he provides twice as much help as you may need.**

**'The friend who is constant in happiness and adversity is to**
**be reckoned as good-hearted on four grounds: he tells you his**
**secrets; he does not betray your secrets; in your troubles he does**
**not forsake you; for your sake he will even lay down his life.**

**'The friend of good counsel is . . . good-hearted on four**
**grounds: he restrains you from doing wrong; he enjoins you to**
**(do what is) right; from him you learn what you had not learnt**
**before; he shows you the way to heaven.**

**'The friend who is sympathetic is to be reckoned as good-**
**hearted on four grounds: he does not rejoice over your mis-**
**fortunes; he rejoices with you in your prosperity; he restrains**
**those who speak ill of you; he commends those who speak well of**
**you.**


**'And** **how,** **young** **householder,** **does** **the** **Aryan** **disciple**
**protect (guard) the six quarters?** **[1]** **The following should be**
**looked upon as the six quarters: parents as the east; teachers**
**as the south; wife and children as the west; friends and com-**
**panions as the north; servants and employees as the nadir;**
**recluses and brahmins (the** **as the zenith.**
_**religieux)**_

**'A child should minister to his parents as the eastern quarter**


**1**
**Now the Buddha explains to Sigala what the six quarters are and how to 'worship'**
**them according to the 'Discipline of the Arya (Noble One)' by way of performing**
**one's duties and obligations towards them, instead of performing the ritual worship**
**according to the old Brahmanic tradition. If the 'six quarters' are 'protected' in this**
**way, they are made safe and secure, and no danger would come from there. Brahmins**
**too worshipped the quarters of the external world to prevent any danger coming**
**from the spirits or gods inhabiting them.**


**122**


**in five ways (saying to himself): Once I was supported by them,**
**now I will be their support; I will perform those dudes they have**
**to perform; I will maintain the lineage and tradition of my**
**family; I will look after my inheritance; and I will give alms**
**(perform religious rites) on behalf of them (when they are dead).**

**'Parents thus ministered to by their children as the eastern**
**quarter, show their love for them in five ways: they restrain**
**them from evil; they direct them towards the good; they train**
**them to a profession; they arrange suitable marriages for them;**
**and in due time, they hand over the inheritance to them.**

**'In this way the eastern quarter is protected and made safe and**
**secure for him.**

**'A pupil should minister to his teachers as the southern**
**quarter in five ways: by rising (from his seat, to salute them);**
**by waiting upon them; by his eagerness to learn; by personal**
**service; and by respectfully accepting their teaching.**

**Teachers, thus ministered to as the southern quarter by their**
**pupil, show their love for their pupil in five ways: they train him**
**well; they make him grasp what he has learnt; they instruct him**
**thoroughly in the lore of every art; they introduce him to their**
**friends and companions; they provide for his security everywhere.**

**'In this way the southern quarter is protected and made safe**
**and secure for him.**

**'A wife as western quarter should be ministered to by her**
**husband in five ways: by respecting her; by his courtesy; by**
**being faithful to her; by handing over authority to her; by**
**providing her with adornment (jewellery, etc.).**

**'The wife, ministered to by her husband as the western quarter,**
**loves him in these five ways: by doing her duty well; by hospitality**
**to attendants, etc.; by her fidelity; by looking after his earnings;**
**and by skill and industry in all her business dealings.**


**'In this way the western quarter is protected and made safe**
**and secure for him.**

**'In five ways a member of a family should minister to his**
**friends and companions as the northern quarter: by generosity;**
**by courtesy; by benevolence; by equality (treating them as he**
**treats himself); and by being true to his word.**

**'Thus ministered to as the northern quarter, his friends and**


123


**companions love him in these five ways: they protect him when he**
**is in need of protection; they look after his property when he is**
**unable to; they become a refuge in danger; they do not forsake**
**him in his troubles; and they respect even others related to him.**


**'In this way the northern quarter is protected and made safe**

**and secure for him.**

**'A master ministers to his servants and employees as the**
**nadir in five ways: by assigning them work according to their**
**capacity and strength; by supplying them with food and wages;**
**by tending them in sickness; by sharing with them unusual**
**delicacies; and by giving them leave and gifts at suitable times.**

**'In these ways ministered to by their master, servants and**
**employees love their master in five ways: they wake up before**
**him; they go to bed after him; they take what is given to them;**
**they do their work well; and they speak well of him and give**
**him a good reputation.**


**'In this way is the nadir protected and made safe and secure**

**for him.**

**'A member of a family (a layman) should minister to recluses**

**and brahmins (the** _**religieux**_ **) as the zenith in five ways: by affec-**

**tionate acts; by affectionate words; by affectionate thoughts;**

**by keeping open house for them; by supplying them with their**

**wordly needs.**

**'In this way ministered to as the zenith, recluses and brahmins**
**show their love for the members of the family (laymen) in six**
**ways: they keep them from evil; they exhort them to do good;**
**they love them with kindly thoughts; they teach them what they**
**have not learnt; they correct and refine what they have learnt;**
**they reveal to them the way to heaven.**

**'In this way is the zenith protected and made safe and secure**
**for him.'**


**When the Blessed One had thus spoken, Sigala the young**
**householder said this: 'Excellent, Sir, excellent! It is as if one**
**should set upright what had been turned upside down, or reveal**
**what had been hidden away, or show the way to a man gone**
**astray, or bring a lamp into darkness so that those with eyes**


1 2 4


**might see things there. In this manner the Dhamma is expounded**
**by the Blessed One in many ways. A n d I take refuge in the Blessed**
**One, in the Dhamma and in the Community of Bhikkhus.**
**May the Blessed One receive me as his lay-disciple, as one who**
**has taken his refuge in him from this day forth as long as life**
**endures.'**

**All (mental) states have mind as their forerunner, mind is their**

**defiled mind, then suffering follows one even as the wheel**

**'He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me':**

2 **22**
By endeavour, diligence, discipline, and self-mastery, let the
wise man make (of himself) an island that no flood can overwhelm.


**26**
Fools, men of litde intelligence, give themselves over to
negligence, but the wise man protects his diligence as a supreme
treasure.


**27**
Give not yourselves unto negligence; have no intimacy with
sense pleasures. The man who meditates with diligence attains
much happiness.

33
This fickle, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to
control, the wise man makes straight, as the fletcher the arrow.

**35**
Hard to restrain, unstable is this mind; it flits wherever it lists.
Good it is to control the mind. A controlled mind brings happiness.

**38**
He whose mind is unsteady, he who knows not the Good
Teaching, he whose confidence wavers, the wisdom of such a
person does not attain fullness.

**42**
Whatever harm a foe may do to a foe, or a hater to another
hater, a wrongly-directed mind may do one harm far exceeding
these.

43
Neither mother, nor father, nor any other relative can do a
man such good as is wrought by a rightly-directed mind.

47
The man who gathers only the flowers (of sense pleasures),


126


whose mind is entangled, death carries him away as a great flood a
sleeping village.

5°
One should not pry into the faults of others, into things done
and left undone by others. One should rather consider what by
oneself is done and left undone.


**[1 ]**
**5**
As a beautiful flower that is full of hue but lacks fragrance,
even so fruitless is the well-spoken word of one who does not
practise it.

**6i**
If, as one fares, one does not find a companion who is better or
equal, let one resolutely pursue the solitary course; there can be no
fellowship with the fool.


**62**
'I have sons, I have wealth': thinking thus the fool is troubled.
Indeed, he himself is not his own. How can sons or wealth be his ?


**64**
Even if all his life a fool associates with a wise man, he will not
understand the Truth, even as the spoon (does not understand)
the flavour of the soup.

**67**
That deed is not well done, which one regrets when it is done
and the result of which one experiences weeping with a tearful
face.


**69**
The fool thinks an evil deed as sweet as honey, so long as it
does not ripen (does not produce results). But when it ripens,
the fool comes to grief.


**81**
Even as a solid rock is unshaken by the wind, so are the wise
unshaken by praise or blame.


127


2 **22**
Even as a lake, deep, extremely clear and tranquil, so do
the wise become tranquil having heard the Teaching.


**85**
Few among men are they who cross to the further shore. The
others merely run up and down the bank on this side.


**90**
For him, who has completed the journey, who is sorrowless,
wholly set free, and rid of all bonds, for such a one there is no
burning (of the passions).


94
He whose senses are mastered like horses well under the
charioteer's control, he who is purged of pride, free from passions,
such a steadfast one even the gods envy (hold dear).


**96**
Calm is the thought, calm the word and deed of him who,
rightly knowing, is wholly freed, perfectly peaceful and equipoised.


97
The man who is not credulous, who knows the 'uncreated',
who has severed all ties, who has put an end to the occasion
(of good and evil), who has vomited all desires, verily he is
supreme among men.


**103**
One may conquer in battle a thousand times a thousand men,
yet he is the best of conquerors who conquers himself.


**104-105**
Better is it truly to conquer oneself than to conquer others.

[1]
Neither a god, nor an 'angel', nor Mara, nor Brahma could turn


_1_
_Gandhabba,_ **freely rendered as 'angel', refers to a class of semi-divine beings:**
**heavenly musicians.**


128


into defeat the victory of a person such as this who is selfmastered and ever restrained in conduct.

**111**
Though one may live a hundred years with no true insight
and self-control, yet better, indeed, is a life of one day for a man
who meditates in wisdom.


**1 1 6**
Make haste in doing good; restrain your mind from evil.
Whosoever is slow in doing good, his mind delights in evil.


**1 1 9**
It is well with the evil-doer until his evil (deed) ripens. But
when his evil (deed) bears fruit, he then sees its ill effects.


**120**
It is ill, perhaps, with the doer of good until his good deed
ripens. But when it bears fruit, then he sees the happy results.


**121**
Do not think lightly of evil, saying: 'It will not come to me'.
Even a water-pot is filled by the falling of drops. Likewise the
fool, gathering it drop by drop, fills himself with evil.


**122**
Do not think lightly of good, saying: 'It will not come to me'.
Even as a water-pot is filled by the falling of drops, so the wise
man, gathering it drop by drop, fills himself with good.


**125**
Whosoever offends an innocent person, pure and guiltless,
his evil comes back on that fool himself like fine dust thrown
against the wind.


**129**
All tremble at weapons; all fear death. Comparing others with
oneself, one should not slay, nor cause to slay.


129


**IJI**
He who, seeking his own happiness, torments with the rod
creatures that are desirous of happiness, shall not obtain happiness
hereafter.


**152**
The man of little learning (ignorant) grows like a bull; his
flesh grows, but not his wisdom.


**155**
Not having lived the Holy Life, not having obtained wealth in
their youth, men pine away like old herons in a lake without fish.


If a man practises himself what he admonishes others to do,
he himself, being well-controlled, will have control over others.
It is difficult, indeed, to control oneself.


**160**
Oneself is one's own protector (refuge); what other protector
(refuge) can there be ? With oneself fully controlled, one obtains a
protection (refuge) which is hard to gain.


**165**
By oneself indeed is evil done and by oneself is one defiled.
By oneself is evil left undone and by oneself indeed is one purified. Purity and impurity depend on oneself. No one can purify
another.


**167**
Do not follow mean things. Do not dwell in negligence.
Do not embrace false views. So the world (i.e. _**Samsara**_, the cycle
of existence and continuity) is not prolonged.


Come, behold this world, how it resembles an ornamented
royal chariot, in which fools flounder, but for the wise there is no
attachment to it.


**130**


**i 7 8**
Better is the gain of Entering the Stream than sole sovereignty
over the earth, than going to heaven, than rule supreme over the
entire universe.


**183**
Not to do any evil, to cultivate good, to purify one's mind,
this is the Teaching of the Buddhas.


**184**
The most excellent ascetic practice is patience and forbearance.
'Nibbana is supreme', say the Buddhas. He indeed is no recluse
who harms another; nor is he an ascetic who hurts others.


**185**
To speak no ill, to do no harm, to practise restraint according to
the fundamental precepts, to be moderate in eating, to live in
seclusion, to devote oneself to higher consciousness, this is the
Teaching of the Buddhas.


1 9 7
Happy indeed we live without hate among the hateful. We live
free from hatred amidst hateful men.


**201**
The conqueror begets enmity; the defeated lie down in distress.
The peaceful rest in happiness, giving up both victory and defeat.


**204**
Health is the best gain; contentment is the best wealth. A trusty
friend is the best kinsman; _**Nibbana**_ is the supreme bliss.


**205**
Having tasted of the flavour of solitude and tranquillity, one
becomes woeless and stainless, drinking the essence of the joy of
Truth.


From lust arises grief; from lust arises fear. For him who is
free from lust there is no grief, much less fear.


131


**222**
He who holds back arisen anger as one checks a whirling
chariot, him I call a charioteer; other folk only hold the reins.


**223**
Conquer anger by love, evil by good; conquer the miser
with liberality, and the liar with truth.


**231**
Be on your guard against physical agitation; be controlled in
body. Forsaking bodily misconduct, follow right conduct in body.


**232**
Be on your guard against verbal agitation; be controlled in
words. Forsaking wrong speech, follow right ways in words.


**233**
Be on your guard against mental agitadon; be controlled in
thoughts. Forsaking evil thoughts, follow right ways in thoughts.


**234**
The wise are controlled in deed, controlled in words, controlled
in thoughts, verily, they are fully controlled.


**239**
By degrees, little by little, from moment to moment, a wise man
removes his own impurities, as a smith removes the dross of
silver.


**240**
As rust, arisen out of iron, eats itself away, even so his own
deeds lead the transgressor to the states of woe.


**248**
Know this, O good man, that evil things are uncontrollable.
Let not greed and wickedness drag you to suffering for a long
time.


132


**2JI**
There is no fire like lust. There is no grip like hate. There is no
net like delusion. There is no river like craving.


**252**
The fault of others is easily seen; but one's own is hard to see.
Like chaff one winnows other's faults; but one's own one
conceals as a crafty fowler disguises himself.


**267**
He who has transcended both merit (good) and demerit (evil),
he who leads a pure life, he who lives with understanding in this
world, he, indeed, is called a bhikkhu.


**268/269**
Not by silence does one become a sage _**{muni)**_ if one be foolish
and untaught. But the wise man who, as if holding a pair of scales,
takes what is good and leaves out what is evil, is indeed a sage.
For that reason he is a sage. He who understands both sides in
this world is called a sage.

**273**
Of paths the Eightfold Path is the best; of truths the Four
Words (Noble Truths); Detachment is the best of states and of
bipeds the Seeing One (the Man of Vision).

**274**
This is the only Way. There is no other for the purification of
Vision. Follow this Way: this is the bewilderment of Mara
(Evil).

**275**
Following this Way you shall make an end of suffering. This
verily is the Way declared by me when I had learnt to remove
the arrow (of suffering).


**276**
You yourselves should make the effort; the Awakened Ones
are only teachers. Those who enter this Path and who are meditative, are delivered from the bonds of Mara (Evil).


iJ3


277
'All conditioned things are impermanent', when one sees this in
wisdom, then one becomes dispassionate towards the painful.
This is the Path to Purity.


**278**
'All conditioned things are _**dukkha**_ (111)', when one sees this
in wisdom, then he becomes dispassionate towards the painful.
This is the Path to Purity.


**279**
'All states _**(dhamma)**_ are without self', when one sees this in
wisdom, then he becomes dispassionate towards the painful.
This is the Path to Purity.


**280**
Who strives not when he should strive, who, though young and
strong, is given to idleness, who is loose in his purpose and
thoughts, and who is lazy—that idler never finds the way to wisdom.


**281**
Watchful of speech, well restrained in mind, let him do no
evil with the body; let him purify these three ways of action, and
attain the Path made known by the Sages.

334
The craving of the man addicted to careless living grows like a
Maluva creeper. He jumps hither and thither, like a monkey in
the forest looking for fruit.

335
Whosoever in this world is overcome by this wretched clinging
thirst, his sorrows grow like Birana grass after rain.

**336**
But whosoever in this world overcomes this wretched craving
so difficult to overcome, his sorrows fall away from him like
water-drops from a lotus (leaf).


134


277

As a tree cut down sprouts forth again if its roots remain
uninjured and strong, even so when the propensity to craving
is not destroyed, this suffering arises again and again.

343
Led by craving men run this way and that like an ensnared
hare. Therefore let the bhikkhu, who wishes his detachment,
discard craving.


**348**
Free thyself from the past, free thyself from the future, free
thyself from the present. Crossing to the farther shore of existence,
with mind released everywhere, no more shalt thou come to
birth and decay.


**360**
Good is restraint of the eye. Good is restraint of the ear. Good
is restraint of the nose. Good is restraint of the tongue.


**361**
Good is restraint of the body. Good is restraint of speech.
Good is restraint of the mind. Restraint everywhere is good.
The bhikkhu restrained in every way is freed from all suffering.


**362**
He who is controlled in hand, controlled in foot, controlled in
speech, and possessing the highest control (of mind), delighted
within, composed, solitary and contented, him they call a bhikkhu.


**365**
One should not despise what one receives, and one should not
envy (the gain of) others. The bhikkhu who envies others does not
attain concentration.

**367**
He who has no attachment whatsoever to Name and Form
(mind and body), and he who does not grieve over what there is
not, he indeed is called a bhikkhu.


135


}68
The bhikkhu, who abides in loving-kindness, who is delighted
in the Teaching of the Buddha, attains the State of Calm, the
happiness of stilling the conditioned things.

**385**
He for whom there exists neither this shore nor the other,
nor both, he who is undistressed and unbound, him I call a
brahman.

**387**
The sun glows by day; the moon shines by night; in his armour
the warrior glows. In meditation shines the brahman. But all day
and night, shines with radiance the Awakened One.


**420**
He whose destiny neither the gods nor demigods nor men do
know, he who has destroyed defilements and become worthy,
him I call a brahman.


**423**
He who knows former lives, who sees heaven and hell, who
has reached the end of births and attained to super-knowledge,
the sage, accomplished with all accomplishments, him I call a
brahman.


T H E L A S T W O R D S O F T H E B U D D H A
Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ananda: 'It
may be, Ananda, that to some of you the thought may come:

[1]
"Here are (we have) the Words of the Teacher who is gone ; our
Teacher we have with us no more". But Ananda, it should not
be considered in this light. What I have taught and laid down,
Ananda, as Doctrine _**(Dhamma)**_ and Discipline _**(Vinaya),**_ this will
be your teacher when I am gone.


_1_
_atitasatthukam pavacanam._ **Rhys Davids' translation: 'The word of the master is**
**ended', does not convey the sense of the original words.**


136


'Just as, Ananda, the bhikkhus now address one another with
the word "Friend" ( _**Avuso**_ ), they should not do so when I am
gone. A senior bhikkhu, Ananda, may address a junior by his
name, his family name or with the word "Friend"; a junior
bhikkhu should address a senior as "Sir" ( _**'Bhante**_ ) or "Venerable"
_**(Ayasma).**_

'If the Sangha (the Community, the Order) should wish it,
Ananda, let them, when I am gone, abolish the lesser and minor
precepts (rules).

[1]
'When I am gone, Ananda, the highest penalty should be
imposed on the Bhikkhu Channa.'

'But, Sir, what is the highest penalty?'
'Let the Bhikkhu Channa say what he likes, Ananda; the
bhikkhus should neither speak to him, nor advise him, nor

[2 ]
exhort him.'

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: 'It may be,
Bhikkhus, that there may be doubt or perplexity in the mind of
even one bhikkhu about the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the
Sangha, or the Path, or the Pracdce. Ask Bhikkhus. Do not
reproach yourselves afterwards with the thought: "Our Teacher
was face to face with us; we could not ask the Blessed One
when we were face to face with him".'

When this was said, the bhikkhus remained silent.
A second time and a third dme too the Blessed One addressed
the bhikkhus . . . as above.

The bhikkhus remained silent even for the third time.
Then the Blessed One addressed them and said: 'It may be,
Bhikkhus, that you put no questions out of reverence for your

[3 ]
Teacher. Then, Bhikkhus, let friend speak to friend.'



**1**
**Literally: 'Divine penalty',** _Brahma-danda._

**2**
**Channa was the close companion and charioteer of Prince Siddhartha before he**
**became the Buddha. Later he entered the Order of the Sangha, was egoistically**
**proud because of his close association with the Master. He tended to be obstinate**
**and self-willed, lacking in proper** _esprit de corps_ **and often behaving perversely.**
**After the** _Parinirana_ **(death) of the Buddha, when Ananda visited Channa and**
**pronounced on him this penalty of a complete social boycott, even his proud spirit**
**was tamed, he became humble, his eyes were opened. Later he mended his ways**
**and became an Arahant, and the penalty automatically lapsed.**

**3**
**The idea is that if they did not like to put any question directly to the Buddha**
**out of respect for their Teacher, a bhikkhu should whisper the question to his**
**friend, and then the latter could ask it on his behalf.**

137


Even at this, those bhikkhus remained silent.
Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One: 'It is
wonderful, Sir. It is marvellous, Sir. I have this faith, Sir, in the
community of bhikkhus here, that not even one of them has any
doubt or perplexity about the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the
Sangha, or the Path, or the Practice.'

'You speak out of faith, Ananda. But in this matter, Ananda,
the Tathagata (i.e. Buddha) knows, and knows for certain,
that in this community of bhikkhus there is not even one bhikkhu
who has any doubt or perplexity about the Buddha, or the
Dhamma, or the Sangha, or the Path, or the Pracdce. Indeed,
Ananda, even the lowest in spiritual attainments among these
five hundred bhikkhus is a Stream-entrant _**(Sotapanna),**_ not liable
to fall (into lower states), is assured, and is bound for Enlightenment.'

Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: 'Then,
Bhikkhus, I address you now: Transient are condidoned things.
Try to accomplish your aim with diligence.'

These were the last words of the Tathagata.
